      "Comment Body: Lesson to be taken away, always, I say ALWAYS wash your device that was submerged under seawater with fresh tap water. This washes away any salt residue that may linger on the casing on the watch.\n",
      "Anyway, I hope you did not press any button whilst swimming as water may have been pushed inside the watch, but however, this was probably the cause of a highly mineralized water. Probably, which has more electrical conductivity than normal. It may have messed with sensors on the watch or the buttons in general. I'm taking a guess. But I hope all is well now. Don't open your watch though. Doing this can actually damage the watch if you do not use the recommended tools. Even using the right tools can cause damage and may lead to it not functioning properly. You might disconnect a certain connector whilst charge/current is still running through the watch even though you have Shut down the watch. It is best you take it to an authorized repair shop and avoid sketchy small ones. Remember, warranty does not cover water damage. You could probably sell it on eBay to diminish the cost you pay for repairing it to buy a new one. Put the listing under \"For Parts or Not Working\", people will buy them.\n",

      "With all that being said, I would probably say go with the 5 if you don't mind the extra cost.

      "I can't speak to battery life on the smaller one as I have the 46mm. But when I first got mine, I was using it for calls and texts at work on Bluetooth and LTE some. I used it for running around an hour and a half three days a week. I tracked my sleep with it. I kept the AOD on all the time. And had heart rate set to every 10 minutes, LTE on auto, WiFi off. I would charge it fully the day before I went back to work, then daily after waking up while I was getting ready for work for an hour or a little less. That would give me more than enough to make it through the day, just not quite a full charge. So by the weekend it was time to fully charge it again.\n",

I usually let my watch charge up to 100% before I go to bed because I use it as my alarm, so I might have it on a bit longer at the end of the day. This morning, for example, I woke up and put it on the charger, and it was at 100% in about 15 minutes. It'll probably be on for about 45 minutes - 1 hour tonight before bed. I also work a job where I can't wear my watch so I put it on theater mode and leave it in my pocket, so it's usually around 60-70% by the end of the day.\n",

      "Comment Body: Interesting. My watch is at 43% now, and I took it off the charger at 94% around 12:45 AM. I've been walking around and biking throughout the day to get to my classes, and with AoD on after I woke up around 8:30 AM. I turn my watch on battery saving mode before I sleep and turn it back on when i wake up. So, given that, I get about 17.5 hours of battery life for every ~50% of battery in my specific use case, which is enough for me as I can charge it when I get back. It's interesting how your battery life is much lower. However, I think it may be that your watch is the celluar version, and you have data roaming active all the time rather than using Bluetooth only when connected to your phone? Having celluar always on will drain the battery quite a bit. That's why I just got a Bluetooth/WiFi version for the Galaxy Watch 5 because I'm always with my phone. But, if you don't have the celluar version of the watch, I'm not sure what the issue is. The only thing left would be the AoD, and you have the brightness always up?\n",

Fda cleared means that its not going to kill you. Also means it's not a medical grade device and a doctor won't risk their license over the data they get. Sounds like you are doing all the right things. I once had a similar situation but mine was detecting afib. Cardiologist told me that the apple watch cannot discern between multiple heart issues so they report afib when it's something else which would be minor and insignificant or could be more substantial\n",

It's still learning my usage patterns but I think the key to getting the most out of the battery on these watches is to limit what features you leave on all the time. It's a dope watch, especially dig the rotating bezel..just hope I can get some decent battery life out of it.\n",

Same reason as to why they have to have warnings not to use a blow dryer while taking a shower or curling iron while sleeping lol.

      "Comment Body: The rotating bezel is what sets Samsung apart in the smartwatch space. In addition it hides the dead bezel area, and makes it functional as well as esthetic. I had a sapphire glass smartwatch prior to my GW4, and I can tell that the bezel assists in keeping the screen clean. Plus I just like the physical sensation of turning it. It makes the product seem like a \"real\" watch and not just some generic wrist computer. Ergonomically it must be better than turning the crown, and if Samsung seriously considers abandoning it, I hope they release the patent. Additionally I think Samsung could develop it much further to capitalize on this unique feature to a greater extent.\n",

Many skipped the 5th generation because it lacked the rotating bezel.

      "Comment Body: As someone who started having heart issues during the beginning of the pandemic,  I can verify it does give accurate readings as I  was able to capture my intermittent irregular rythms and confirm through my cardiologist the same thing in person (I never had a cardiologist before this). Just to be perfectly clear....ANY IRREGULAR RYTHM is going to show as AFIB on ALL galaxy watches regardless of whats going on such as tachycardia or brachycardia etc, but mine was an extra premature beat now being treated with a medication.  I wouldn't chance it and get yourself checked out.  There are many examples of people who have saved their own lives through this Samsung ekg feature and then going to their doctor or ER. See if it's repeatable, or intermittent as mine was and save or print out the ekg to show your doc. It's no joke. I had an ekg in the doctor's office which showed the exact same signature as my watch and although this was almost 3 years ago using my GW3...the docs were amazed with its accuracy compared to a multi lead ekg.\n",

      "FWIW, I've tested HR during a medical stress test and it was on point.  Same for the sleep features.  It regularly picks up when I am having cardiac issues, however the reporting can be inaccurate.  For example, PVCs (extra heartbeats that don't fully contract) will show as AFib.  Also of note, and this is with ALL bloop pressure and pulse machines, PVC's can significantly impact the perceived heart rate.  For example during severe PVCs (very uncomfortable) my pulse will read in the 30s.  The pulse machine is not picking up on the \"misfires\".  \n",

      "Don't worry too much but definitely mention it to your doctor, as they can easily check it out.  Also, if your doctor/hospital system uses something like Epic MyChart, you can upload all of your watch data there.

I feel this is trend is going to be hugely beneficial as AI accelerates in medical technology and can be a wonderful diagnostic tool.

      "Comment Body: Hard to tell based off this image. Its not super high quality so I can't tell if there are all discernable P waves. Looks like a regular rhythm. Usually AFib will not have p waves and be irregular. Next time you check your ecg, sit down and stay as still as possible for the best reading. If it keeps alerting you of AFib, go get checked out by your doc. I've have plenty of patients that have been diagnosed with AFib and the only way they knew to go get checked was their watch telling them it was picking up AFib. These are pretty good at detecting it at this rate of development.\n",

      "I'd never recommend spending extra money because it's something you \"might\" do at some point.  You either already know if you need it or not.  If you're saying \"this might be something I want to do once or twice\" then the answer is no.\n",

      "To get it down to just my personal example, LTE on the watch sounds great, in theory.  I have a personal situation where I need to be able to be contacted at all times, day or night.  Having an LTE watch would add a layer of redundancy.  But realistically, I've lived with this reality for so long that my phone is always near me no matter what, so having an LTE watch really doesn't matter.  And also my phone is my camera, and I go nowhere without a camera.  So while I like the theory, I'll never be going anywhere without my phone, so LTE on the watch would be a waste of money.\n",

      "\n",
      "[https://www.fiercewireless.com/iot/25m-cellular-capable-smartwatches-will-be-sold-globally-year-ccs-insight-says](https://www.fiercewireless.com/iot/25m-cellular-capable-smartwatches-will-be-sold-globally-year-ccs-insight-says)\n",
      "\n",
      "so about 21% of all smartwatches shipped.  Those numbers are old, so lets even assume that the percentage of cellular smartwatches shipped now has increased.  I'll even say it's increased to 35%.  That's a jump of 14% of total, but represents an increase in percentage by 67% of sales of cellular smartwatches.  I think that number is probably high, but considering we don't have any real data, sure lets call it that number.\n",
      "\n",
      "So, if we assume an increase of sales of cellular smartwatches by 67%, that still represents only 35% of the total number of smartwatches.  How many of those have cellular service?  The answer isn't 100%.  Again, we don't have good numbers here, but lets even assume it's 80%.  I personally think that's high, but again we don't have any definitive numbers so it is a guess.\n",
      "\n",
      "80% of that 35% works out to 28%.  So that works out to 28% of all smartwatches having LTE service.\n",
      "\n",
      "How many of those 28% that have LTE service actually use it a significant amount? The number isn't 0, but it isn't 100%.  Again, lets be generous and say that 75% of people with an LTE smartwatch use it in a loosely defined \"regular\" basis.  I think that number is extremely high, but again there are no usage stats, so a guess.\n",
      "\n",
      "75% of that 28% is 21%.\n",

During the stress test, the goal is to push you to a certain heart rate, then it terminates the test.  My Galaxy Watch Pro was within a few points off the stress test monitors.  I've been really happy with it.\n",

      "Comment Body: I have owned all the Sammy watch versions. Overall the entire generations have had the same issue. It is great for stationary exercise. I also noticed that with the Apple Watch Ultra, the heart rate was not as accurate as the Series 8 so, the bulk might have something to do with the 5 Pro as it might have a tendency to shift around the wrist. Recently, I had the 5 Pro and experienced the same issue that you did when exercising. When not exercising, the heart rate was much more consistent. In the end, I returned the 5 Pro and went back to the Pixel watch. I find the Pixel watch very accurate, when I use silicone bands. If I opt for the leather or nylon, that one has issues with accuracy. I presume its lightweight and smaller nature also help with accuracy. Quantified Scientist does extensive reviews for wearables on YouTube and has reviewed the 5 Pro for various workout accuracies. DesFit and DC Rainmaker also have done the same.\n",

My note 10 plus is still at a estimated 86% battery health with accubattery and its been used daily since launch streaming tv/YouTube all day at work. Even my cordless vaccum I take off the charger when it's close to 90%. I don't let any devices drop below 30% if I can avoid it as well. I wish the galaxy watch and buds had the option to protect the batteries during charge like the Samsung phones do. Maybe 2-3 times a year I'll disable the protect and run to 14% then do a full charge but I can say with 100% confidence it does make a difference if you keep your devices longer than a year or 2. I also had a s10+ on another line I used even less than the note and knew I would trade that one in so I didn't have the protection set on it and it was down to 72% overall health when I just traded it in towards the S23 Ultra.

I charge both to 100% all the time, I usually charge when it's around 15% is interesting what people are saying about the charging. IIRC in the  manual it does say it's good to let your watch run out completely as it keeps it refreshed same for phone!  This should be fine at l least every 6 months!  I feel that if people continue to charge their phones to 80% that the watch losses that unused %20, use your watch and charge it as and when it requires and what works for you, but do occasionally let it ruin out , just for information regarding my phone's being kept at 100%,  over the years it did use to shut off at 5% so that is obviously percentage lost over time, occasionally it was 2%, and sometimes 6%, those phones are still going strong and still look like new, especially my S4, S6 and S8!.\n",

So for practical purposes, charging to 80% and discharging to 20%. There's a reason why Samsung phones have the \"battery protect\" option (which I wish the watch had as well) that limits the maximum charge to 85%. Keeping them fully charged or depleted is when they experience the most wear.\n",

It was only my thought that the 20% would gradually get lost any way I suppose due to the old type of memory batteries in the phones I know li ion batteries aren't suppose to have memory loss though. I try not to discharge completely on a regular as in daily, usually try and charge at 15% as a rule but have found myself charging at various points and depending on how long I'm going to be out so making sure I have enough charge to last me.  I'm wondering how it will last in the summer though.  I'm the UK we have been known for it too get quite hot occasionally but it seems too becoming a regular occurrence and I'm often in short sleeves then. I'm keeping a record of how long the battery is playing and what percentage and if using power saving or not,  and recently added which watch face im usingmakes some interesting reading Although it is now becoming a bit of an obsession  with me with keeping these stats.

Battery University has a Depth of Discharge chart which will give you an idea of the number of cycles the battery will go through before dropping below a threshold of capacity.   \n",

Apparently according to my cardiologist the apple watch isn't a medical grade device and cannot distinguish between afib and other semi normal stuff. In the end he told me not to worry about it and was appreciative that I brought the printouts to him. There is a product called kardiamobile who claims to do a multi lead ekg. In the end might confuse u but u might look at it to validate ur findings. But u might want to consider doing some research on that product.

So many of them are similar so it's like looking for a needle in the haystack but when you find one you like, it's like finding treasure. I started by searching in the Samsung store. It will help if you include tizen in your search.  Don't get suckered into the apps where you design your own, or they claim a wild amount of faces. Unfortunately, most of the ones I liked were an additional charge.I ended up buying some just so I could keep track of them and then I never used them. I found one I really liked and have kept it. The best thing to do is just explore all the options. If you find a watch face you like, make a note of the name so you can find it again. Enjoy your new watch!\n",

When I got my first Gear2 there were very few feminine watch faces, more for my Gear4 but really had to search them out. Now I scrolled on watch faces and see all sorts of new floral ones. SIGH I know I'm going to spend HOURS looking at watch faces and it's all your fault! 😁 what type of face are you looking for? Make sure when you're looking you tap on the icon of your connected watch right under the search bar. I think it defaults to phone and it will help if results of your search are for your Gear5.

Installed and downloaded are 2 different things.  They can remain in your downloaded watchfaces and reinstalled whenever you want to use them . Also, remember the more watch faces you have downloaded can also affect the performance of the watch. There are only 16 gbs of storage, and watch faces take up quite a bit of space.  Especially if you download a lot of different faces. Eventually, everyone finds 1 or 2 after the hype is over, lol.\n",

I would use it at work for answering calls and text, over both Bluetooth and LTE if I left my phone at my desk. I found the best routine was to get a full charge on one of my days off.

When I was doing research about which Galaxy watch would fit my taste better I didn't find a lot of opinions of women at least for the classic, so I would leave this post for women in a similar situation. I prefer my watches to look like watches, not really a sporty minimal girl more of a classic productivity girl.\n",

I have GPS on, bluetooth headphones on playing music from the watch and I am remotely connected to my phone through LTE.

I've logged about 12 runs so far since I got the watch but I haven't tried to go for nearly two hours like you did though so maybe those numbers would change if I extended my time.\n",

      "Comment Body: It's really down to your own personal choice and what you are actually looking due your watch to provide.  Take your time, do your research and read reviews and comments.  I personally got a watch 5 bt version. I deliberated over the 4 and the classic and did a lot of searching on what would be better for me.  I really liked the look of the 5 and it's capabilities but worried about battery life. Still find the odd time when it r runs out unexpectedly. I came from a galaxy fit2 SM-R220 which had excellent battery life of 3 weeks. What attracted me to the 5 was the body composition and the ecg as I am prone to feeling faint at times.  My previous fit2 which I have still got, didn't have these features, although message and call notifications were there and BP measuring and steps. I would have to have my phone near me to reply or answer calls. The 5 allowed me a little more freedom although i still tend to find it easier to use my phone than the watch. I also liked the fact that you could change and download Watchfaces which I'm doing all the time and also change bands and different cases. I also liked the fact that the watch 5 was a newer system. I sent for the 40mm feeling that the 44mm or pro would look far too big for my wrist. Coming from the oblong shape of the r220 to the 5 round shape,  it did appear large at first, but I'm  now use to it. Battery life I have to charge daily to day half depending on usage and watch face used.  More basic styles such as the classic analog watch face and darker screen gives longer batter life whilst still adding the steps in the background.  I have aod-off, wifi- on,  touch to wake- on,  bt- on heart rate- manual stress- continously blood oxygen during sleep- on, snore detection-a always,  activities to detect- walking/ running- automatically- on,  I also have google assistant voice commands off. I understand the 4 classic has a rotating bezel,  I use my touchscreen 'riotatng' bezel which you have to activate and find I use it all the time. But coming from the 4 I don't miss not having it. The 4 also is understood to have worse battery life was a recent update may had change that.  I used my r220 as an example as that was my first smart watch/ fitness tracker and my way into smart watches. I wouldn't be without either now. I hope you find this useful and may help you in your decision,  do look at some you tube reviews, like I did add there are so many out there to help you make the right decision for you, as only you can really decide. 😀\n",

      "Comment Body: I got the GW4 classic 42mm for 100 on eBay, just as new, OEM charger and everything. To me is soooo worth it, I prefer the classic look over the sporty one, but I must say, that if battery life is important to you at least in this size, I’m not able to get a full day plus sleep. But really to me is not a big deal, I can charge 30 minute in between the day. But if battery life is important to you go for the 46mm or the watch 5\n",

      "Comment Body: I must admit since I've had the 5 I've been keeping the results of the battery and how long it lasts on a daily basis depending on w which watch face I've used.   The one I'm using at present has given me a so far 1 day and  12h usage.  I have not had it in power saving mode, but it did go into sleep mode from 1 am to 7 am this morning due to routines I had set up.  I'm just about to put it on charge right now. So yes once the battery has equalised and you keep the  same face for aa few days as it still learns (I've had a difference of 1hr extra a day) the r battery seems to keep adapting all the time.  Sleep tracking I find it's really good.  That also improves ovrr time. When I first had the watch I was always touching it. Like a new toy. New I've settled down a bit.  What I do regret was in the first week not having everything on and nt having fully brightness etc  as the watch adapts to your usage so if I had to had full brightness on battery drains faster.  If it had adapted to that earlier I think my v watch may even have a 2 day battery life by now. I've also bought a USB watch power bank which would give a top up if iout and about.\n",

      "I bought it for 20.000vnd (1$). Price could be different for every country tho. I like it because of the AOD display. It's very battery efficient. The watchface itself is also pretty nice imo. I just don't like digital flashy watchfaces and want to go with something simple. The strap is Milanese strap, can be found on AliExpress. The bezel is silver time metal bezel, also on AliExpress.\n",

I like how it's still chonky and sporty despite not looking like a G-Shock clone, which is a breath of fresh air compared to most other rugged watch cases out there for the Watch 4 Classic. The material is durable and/or flexible in areas where it matters. The built-in bezel ring works well without the need for adhesives. There also isn't much a gap between the straps and my arm which is good. 😊\n",

The no-brand Chinese one works with a fuller  coverage, and seems to be durable enough to last for multiple uses and cheap enough to be replaced. Mind you I'm planning to use these to convert my Watch to silver for formal occasions to make it look like a dress watch, so I won't be daily driving the case.

If you flip the watch over- on the underside, you'll see the strap material overlaps where the strap meets the underside of the watch. Smart, i thought. Until I lifted the overlapping flaps and discovered they'd been rubbing on the face of the underside of the watch creating two indelible, dull marks where the strap had rubbed against the shiny black metal of the watch. It completely destroyed the resale value of the watch. That being said, if you have a case on the watch, it might be safe.

The phone can track find and share location with anyone. each watch connects with only 1 phone.\n",

      "Comment Body: Amazon has a huge assortment of straps[.](https://straps.You) You can look them up by your model so you get the right width. I hate the silicone straps that come with smart watches. I made sure to get replacement straps that included the pins for the straps. Also, the new pins have little knobs on them to make them easier to pinch to remove them. They weren't around when I got my first Gear watch years ago. They might be standard now, just be careful to look for them. You may like some of the elastics one that come in a variety of patterns. Also, I have a mesh one that uses a magnet as the clasp. Both styles would suit a large frame person and they are very comfortable for anyone. The elastic one I liked got stretched out but it's easy to adjust so it lasted about two years.\n",

      "The answer is that modern AMOLED is good enough that burnin really isn't a concern anymore, so both Google and Samsung don't use it on their watches anymore.

Same goes for the gw4, didn't get any burnin over the year i had it, aod always on.\n",

I believe the only difference between an LTE and the regular version is the ability of the LTE enabled watch is being able to use the LTE watch as a phone without your cell phone it's partnered with to be close by. I now have the Gear 4 and love many of it's capabilities. The fact that it works as a phone has come in handy when my phone hasn't been close. I especially appreciate it as a safety net because no matter where my cell is, I can call someone if I need to. BUT, it does cost about 15 dollars a month on my cell phone plan. Make sure your plan can do that. I found out today that Xfinity mobile doesn't support Samsung LTE watches. I think Samsung's website had a comparison chart. You could look there.\n",

The way to change the input method in Samsung's keyboard is to swipe from the bottom of the keyboard and choose either the microphone (voice), drawing, smiley, text or numbers. You also have the settings icon. The selected input method will appear as the default the next time the keyboard opens. If it's the voice you won't even need to tap on a microphone, as is the case in Gboard, you can start talking straight away.

      "Comment Body: I have a Note 10 phone and the Gear 4 LTE watch. Not sure what your priorities are but I'd like to recommend you consider the LTE version so it really acts like an extension of your phone even if they aren't in proximity with each other. If I'm outside and far out of reach of my cell I still get and can make calls and get and send texts. That has come in handy so many times and it's also a safety feature because I can call for help if something happens and I don't have my Note 10 on me. You do have to add it to your cell phone service but the cost isn't much, about 15 dollars a month.\n",

So it's fine for me if I have to charge it every day. That's why I am looking for a better Software experience. And i am also just disappointed that Mobvoi never delivered on its promise of Wear OS 3.\n",

And especially compared with the Ticwatch the 44mm will even be small. And if the battery is better that's good. A day of use is fine, I charge my phone over night so having to do the same with the watch is fine.\n",

      "Comment Body: Yes, if they are in your watch face cue, they are also running in the background.  My battery on my watch 4 was about 2 days, not terrible, but on this pro, I get a little better 3 days solid. So if you pess and hold your watch face and if you have more than 2 you have too much running hence battery drain. However, just because they have been removed from up top does not mean you lose them.  They will stay safe and sound until you want to install them again. Now downfall to tgat. The more you have installed (downloaded) the the worse watch performs.  I myself tried downloading a bunch when I first got it, but I realized I only have one watch. Find 1 or 2 perfect for you watches, download it, and try it.  If you don't like it get rid of it or keep it till  you find a better one. Remember, you can always reinstall from the playstore.  It won't forget you purchases, and you can always re-download so they are not lost.  Now clean up the that mess, and your battery will increase 10 fold.\n",

I like to keep one of my old chargers packed in an overnight bag for ski weekends so I'll never forget to pack it. Also helps that the old cords are USB-A since my computer and laptop only have 1 USB-C port but multiple USB-A ports, and I have plenty of spare USB-A charger blocks to plug them into outlets. I know for sure the original GW (1?) (upright, not flat disc) charger will not charge an AW2, GW4, or GW5 as someone gave me one that I had intended to use as a spare charger.\n",

      "If it is like my issues, it will slowly get worse until the GPS doesn't connect at all. You may have an exercise here or there that tracks well, but mostly they will be crap. It's not just Samsung Health, but all apps that use GPS. Google Maps/Fit seems to pull GPS from my phone, but if the watch is in airplane mode or I turn my phone off, it does not get a GPS lock. I tried using [Wear GPS Fix](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.freepoc.weargpsfix&hl=en_US&gl=US&referrer=utm_source%3Dgoogle%26utm_medium%3Dorganic%26utm_term%3Dwear+gps+fix+google+play&pcampaignid=APPU_1_dun6Y9DgBd2B0PEPhvuriAg)and [this app](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=io.trackwear.gnss) to see if the GPS was functioning and they saw zero or one satellite and would not connect to the satellite when they did see it. It's like the GPS chip is damaged or has a bad connection. \n",

I waited until the next update, which didn't fix the problem, and then I factory reset the watch. That didn't help either so I sent the watch to Samsung under warranty. They sent it back without repairing it because the diagnostic tests said location was accurate. Samsung had factory reset the watch so I set it back up and it still didn't work.\n",
      "\n",
      "It's currently back with Samsung again right now. A technician called me to talk about my issues because the diagnostics again said location was functioning correctly. I said I would email more information and screenshots. The technician said would she would note in my case that I was sending more information and they would hold the watch until it was received and reviewed. However, before I could send the information to them, I got an email saying the watch would be shipped back unrepaired. I sent an email expressing my frustration that the watch was being shipped back before I had a chance to provide more information and included screenshots showing the GPS deteriorating until it would no longer connect.

In the meantime, if you choose to use Google Assistant to set reminders, the metadata will land in your Google Calendar for now.  Hope this helps, have a great day.\n",

The way I did it was pretty simple, I bought 20mm pins on amazon, pulled the 22mm pins out of the mobyfox bands and then replaced it with the 20mm. I wouldnt recommend this anymore since they have official samsung bands now and eventually I am assuming all collections will be apple and samsung compatible. However, if there is one you really want that isn't a samsung band you can make it work. I did this same process with 6 MobyFox watch bands.\n",

You have to apply them.. the second one and then check out the AOD... you can't see a preview because it's AOD (we hope that this will be fixed soon by Samsung/Google).

You should have talked to Sprint and told them that it wasn't activated with cellular service they could have fixed it for you.  What am I saying, it's Sprint. Worst service provider. Watches do not have as strong radio as a phone does. That means even when activated it's possible that the watch may not work in standalone if your service is marginal. Like 2 bars will work on a phone, three bars will definitely work on a phone. But in that same location it's unlikely the watch will get service.\n",

      "Comment Body: I would believe the Samsung calorie burn metrics before any machine.  At best, all elliptical machines (and as a trainer, I have experience with literally hundreds of machines over the past 25 years) greatly over state calorie burned as do step and treadmills. I have proven it myself by doing a fitness workout under a fitness lab using Vo2 max and heart sensors and it's ALWAYS way lower than any machine states. The watch through your Samsung account, has all your real metrics which aren't an option on gym machines.  Things like Male/Female,  fitness level, Height, etc.  Most commercial elliptical machines are ALWAYS high in calorie burn even though you can set them up with age and weight.\n",
      "You get much more sophisticated results purposely Starting and Finishing each workout from your watch such as Heart rate recovery among other things. I have had 4 Galaxy watches and always turn off auto detect workout because I find it starts workouts doing random things such as washing my hair lol or even a little fun time with my wife. Your daily results will generally be skewed and more battery usage with auto workout detect on as well.  So don't jump to conclusions about which is better... Old versus new because the sensors and OS are much more advanced in the GW4.  I am not saying the GW4 or 5 Pro is perfect, but the metrics get better with each watch generation.\n",

      "Comment Body: The Watch 4 is when Samsung moved to Wear OS. Before that they used their own OS called Tizen. Many people have likely switched to Wear OS hoping to have a better selection of apps since it's Google Android now. Samsung is doing 3 years of updates on their watches, so you will get at least one more UI update on the 4. Even without updates, it will still have access to apps in the Play Store.\n",

But if you like the look of the bezel, none of that should deter you from the 4 Classic. If you were just looking at a regular Watch 4, then I'd say go ahead and get the 5.\n",

      "\n",
      "The Watch 5 is thicker and heavier than the 4 (already very thick in my view) and has worse/same battery life in initial reviews (due to extra sensors I think). IIRC it also has the same chip and RAM? Or maybe slightly better chip but negligible performance difference from when I looked up reviews. For basic heart tracking there will be no difference, the 5 touts some exclusive new heart sensor features though so up to you if you value those. \n",
      "\n",
      "I actually bought the 4 after the 5 came out - I went for the Classic because I found the physical rotating bezel a lot better to use than the soft touch bezels. So in my view I was essentially getting similar hardware for half the price. Nothing against the 5 but it's only slight incremental hardware upgrades (chip/RAM/sensors that matter for me) and software is the same (unlike the 3 which wasn't Wear OS).\n",

Personaly I've got great battery life with a few steps: no aod, no raise to wake or tap to wake, wifi off, bt on, continuous heart rate and stress. I also uninstalled google assistant and bixby via adb (just a few commands on the pc that aren't risky at all if you follow all the right steps and all changes are reversable). Another thing that could impact the battery life could be the fact that I use a samsung phone, I heard of people with Google Pixel that had a really bad battery life. A thing that could help with performance and stabilty maybe affecting also the battery is wiping the cache partition (I always do it after an update)\n",

      "Comment Body: I have the Galaxy Watch 5 Pro and it's probably the same size in proportion to my wrist as the non-Pro version is on yours.  It helps if you get a different strap that is less rigid.  I use a semi-flexible nylon sports strap which goes straight down from the lugs onto my wrist instead of bulging outward before curving down like the standard strap you are using.  They can be had for very cheaply on Amazon and are very comfortable.  In fact, they may help stabilize the watch on your wrist better than the standard strap; that's key to getting any remotely decent readings from the sensors on the watch.  I bought this for my Watch 5 Pro:\n",

      "About a week ago, I went swimming with it in a pool roughly about 2m deep for about an hour. It was still working after the swim but screen became unresponsive. Following day left it for a while then battery eventually went flat. Tried charging it up. It wouldn't boot up. Noticed a bit moisture under the sensor cover (for lack of better description). I simply pushed it and found the gasket was worn away. Used some silicon bead (the stuff that usually comes with new bags and stuff to remove moisture) to remove the moisture from the watch for a day. When ever I reboot it on charger it will only get me this far or just get stuck on 0%. What may be the potential issue?\n",

The display was severely messed up because the touch screen doesn't register touches in most places.\n",

      "\n",
      "The temperature that a battery sensor in a smartwatch is indicating can be influenced by various factors, including whether the watch is worn or not. When the watch is worn, the temperature around the battery may be affected by the temperature of the wearer's skin and the ambient temperature in the surrounding environment. This can result in a slightly higher temperature reading than when the watch is not worn and is exposed to the ambient temperature alone.\n",
      "\n",
      "However, it's important to note that the battery sensor in a smartwatch is typically designed to monitor the battery's internal temperature, which may not be directly affected by the temperature around the watch. The internal temperature of the battery is primarily influenced by factors such as its charging and discharging status, the battery's capacity, and its age. Therefore, the impact of the watch being worn or not on the battery's internal temperature may be relatively minor, especially if the watch is designed to account for these factors.\n",

I am aware of RSW using more battery but I prefer it when driving etc... About the accuracy, I do find it accurate though! The heart rate and BP is all that matters and it seems to me pretty close to the machine I used before... I would love to use it for Samsung pay but it doesn't work in my region!

If it's getting better then you know it's fungal. If you see no change then move onto a simple anti bacterial cream. I use a simple iodine solution because idione is not harmful to you and is actually good for your health... again, if no improvement after a few days it's not bacterial. That means it's most likely some form of irritation. I'd take the watch off a few days straight and see if the condition improves over that time.\n",

The newer watches run on wear os and I think it's significantly better. I went from the 3 to the 4. The bad thing about the 4 is the battery life is awful compared to the 3 and now the 5. If I were you I would wait for the next watch to come out in August and pair it with the s23 ultra and I think you'll be happy. Google assistant on the new watch is SOOOOOOO much better than Bixby. Bixby is the worst thing to come to any smart device, it's terrible. If money is any issue I suppose you could get the watch 5 but I'd wait for the newer model if you can.\n",

My watch told me one day that my heart rate was extremely elevated(over 140) while otherwise doing no activity, and,  checking the ECG after that notification, it said I was having an afib episode.  I went to ER after it didn't resolve itself after a few hours, and they had me do the Valsalva maneuver, which broke the arrhythmia and \"reset\" my heart.  We talked a bit about causes and I told them what was going on at the time (poor sleep quality ~5hrs per night and palpitations when I do that for a few days in a row, 2-3 glasses of coffee and/or caffeinated soda per day, occasional alcohol, significant stress) and they told me that it's likely periodic afib influenced by those conditions.  They gave me some hydroxyzine to calm me down and take only if needed if I'm very anxious or need help sleeping, and instructed me to do some behavioral modification as a starting point.  \n",
      "\n",
      "I get 6-8 hours of sleep per night now, I've cut my caffeine intake to 1 cup of coffee per day and cut out soda almost completely, and I watch my heart rate and do calming exercises/breathing exercises if I feel like it's creeping up or if I'm just stressed out.  I followed up with my cardiologist and they put me on a Holter monitor for a few days to check me out and had me do a stress test, and, in the end, he agreed with what the ER doctor said and they're just monitoring me with periodic visits unless something happens.  \n",
      "\n",
      "I have a beta blocker I can take if I start feeling really strong palpitations(he says it's \"extra heartbeats\") or a sustained abnormally high heart rate, but it's only as needed.  I've read about what u/woodsro00 said about beta blockers and periodic afib, so I'm concerned about taking it and making it permanent and haven't really felt like I've been in a situation where I really want to take it.  \n",
      "\n",
      "Since my behavioral modifications, I've yet to have a similar episode, though occasionally if I feel weird, I'll check the ECG for afib and a handful of times(<5) over the 6 months since my ER visit my watch says I am irregular but it goes away in the morning(it seems to happen when my heart rate drops below 60 while I'm in bed), so I've followed up with my cardiologist and he said I just need to make sure I'm getting enough rest because it doesn't happen when I'm well rested.  Those nights I usually take the hydroxyzine because I'll start to get really stressed out and that really helps me get a good night's rest.  \n",

      "If it becomes a greater problem, I'll probably get an ablation, but the cardiologist wants to hold off for now.\n",

      "Comment Body: Thank you so much and thanks for asking. They really don't know a cause for Afib, but my ER doctor said it can be quite common in athletic people. It doesn't always indicate a true 'heart condition'. He said there is a dime-sized area on the top of your heart that is kind of the 'quarterback' that tells the 2 halves of your heart to push blood through in a synchronized way. With Afib that doesn't work properly and the top half doesn't beat in synchronized rhythm with the lower half, which can lead to high blood pressure, clots, dizziness, tiredness because the blood doesn't properly circulate. If the blood clots it could travel to your brain and cause a stroke. So it's something that shouldn't be taken lightly.\n",
      "\n",
      "My ER doc was telling me from first-hand experience, since he is also fit (and a pilot, still in active military) and experienced Afib himself. He said the meds (beta-blocker and blood thinner) were not an option for him because he would lose active flight status.  So he said an ablation (which he compared to soldering a 'bad' connection) could fix the misfiring without the need for medications. That's what he chose. I'm meeting with the cardiologist for the first time tomorrow, so we'll see what options I have and assess the risks associated with each. The ER doc assured me I would still be fine to resume normal activities in a week either way (after adjusting to the meds I'm on now).\n",

      "In my case it was definitely the phone initiating the disconnect since it suddenly had reinstalled the Galaxy Wearable, and all my settings were gone on the phone side. I talked to Samsung support staff who right away said \"it's probably a new version.\" Nonsense statement, as I checked it.\n",
      "\n",
      "To further confuses matters, today I noticed that when I enter the Play store from my phone the only Galaxy Wearable app being presented is called Galaxy Wearable (Samsung Gear) v 2.2.54.22112861, last updated Dec 13, 2022. So the claim by the Samsung support staff that it probably was a new update was just assumption on their part and no explanation of what happened.\n",
      "\n",
      "I have a Galaxy Watch 4 Classic LTE so I  would not expect the (Samsung Gear) version, but that's the only one being offered. It's got 500 mn+ downloads and an average score of 3.7. In the app description it says \"supported devices vary depending on your region, operator and device model.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "From my PC I see there is another Galaxy Wearable app with 1 mn+ downloads and a 4.0 average score. It was last updated Dec 18, 2022. The Play store informs that this app is \"not available for any of your devices.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "All in all this suggests both Samsung and Google present different smartwatch offerings in different markets.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Assistant is not available in the Play store from my watch. Simple as that. That's why resetting is not a very attractive proposition. It took Samsung support about two hours to get it working on my device, and they had to do a work around to do so. Unfortunately nine out of ten of their support staff have no clue, but this one staff member did know his away around because he actually had his own smartwatch. Not that that should be a requirement but mostly the staff just presents nonsense ready made broken record replies. I was amazed at the support I got but I cannot expect it to be the same this time around, as I already have experienced this week. I spent over two hours  with them yesterday and even though I repeated several times this was the LTE watch, and the watch model number they still referred to the bluetooth version and kept using the wrong model nomenclature. A total waste of time.\n",
      "\n",
      "Keep on the watch works over the watch's LTE connection, I can add new items and read entries made from other units. Not dependent on the phone. I had some trouble initially where it didn't maintain access to the database after a couple of hours and then the only way to get it working again I had to have it reinstalled.\n",
      "\n",
      ">The backup/restore is only for built in apps/settings, so they won't back up things like keep/assistant.\n",
      "\n",
      "So where can I see the back up restore? It certainly wasn't visible on the phone with the Galaxy Wearable reinstalled. Since the watch in the account at samsung dot com has been inactivated - and it sure wasn't me that did it - the Samsung support staff said there probably won't be any back up of anything. They could not explain why it had been inactivated and only stated they have no access to that account.  That's really, really worrying because when I set it up again, this whole process could repeat itself. Furthermore there was no communication at any point in time  that it had been inactivated, and I didn't notice as everything was working.Comment Body: What's the problem?

I have also noticed Samsung has been tweaking their various widgets lately (except for the Samsung Health widgets, which incidentally also don't work well with Nova launcher as they are too big to fit in the regular grid). The others widgets are all fine now. But yeah, I guess it's up to the Nova launcher guys to ensure widgets look the same on their launcher as they do on stock launchers.

Be it not wanting an iPhone 🙋🏻‍♂️ (I get bored looking at that phone in the first couple of weeks), not looking like every other citizen on the street, and wanting a 'regular round' watch (because why not?), the round watch makes perfect sense, not to mention that they do make you stand out these days.\n",

I don't miss the Apple Watch that much and it actually does some other things the Apple Watch doesn't, so I gotta say I got pretty much used to it well - apart from that battery life (which still beats the competitor, but still poor to my liking). All in all, I agree with you in 'practical terms', but  overall I think the rounded watches (from Samsung bc other brands haven't quite nailed the experience yet imo) are the way to go for me.
