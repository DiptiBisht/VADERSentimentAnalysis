I wear it all the time day/night, the only occasion that I take it off is when I take shower or charge it. There is no any sign of fading out for now, the only thing that I can give you as an advice is to buy a screen protector for it (I bought some from Aliexpress) cuz the screen is not sapphire and it can be easily scratched, you won't even notice that there is a protector. Other then that the battery life is mind blowing - at least 7 days easy. Work out tracking, sleep monitoring and statistics are great as well.",/r/HuaweiWatchGT/comments/11r44v6/huawei_watch_gt_3_46mm_color/jc6lod4/

I had a Huawei watch fit for like a year or a little bit more, and was using it paired to an iphone at the time.

Weird thing is I also had an apple watch s5, and I did wore them both at the same time, at some point I compared the readings for hr through the day and they were basically spot on.

For the price I thought the watch fit was a big deal, so when I switched back to android being bored of IOS and all the restrictions they have, I went and bought the gt runner for running purposes.

Long story short while battery life was amazing, and HR readings where on par for the exercises I did on a daily basis at the time, the big lack of functions or metrics regarding health conditions made me sell it, and just leveraged a bundle pack from Samsung, the watch 5 pro was free buying a s22 ultra and mi GF needed a new phone.

Software support was actually pretty bad too now that I reflect on it.

It was only good and receiving updates every month for like 6 months.

Don't be fooled thinking that battery life will make it up for the lack of functions unless you actually know for sure you only need workouts tracking and basic notifications.

But if you need a little bit more than that, go for a good wear os based smartwatch, charging every day is well worth it for having a reduced smartphone om your wrist.

Feature set wise they look about equal (though if GPS tracking accuracy matters to you, I think the GT3 will be better as I think that series is all dual-band GNSS where as WF2 looks like it's single band GNSS).

  
In my case, I took a GT Runner over a WatchFit 2 due to additional battery life and dual-band GNSS. The fact that I could pick up a GT Runner for less than a WatchFit 2 as well due to the current pricing specials made it even more sweet too.",/r/HuaweiWatchGT/comments/11gx06m/gt3_vs_watch_fit_2/jb76t5e/

Just restarted again and it's still not bringing up any notifications. Will see if support can issue an update with the information I have given them. Thanks and all the best 👍🏽

Update...
I've already done some of this before to no avail but this below has fixed it. Maybe of some help to those having issues. The sequence may not be exact but here's what I did:
- Bluetooth settings on iPhone>Forget this Device for both entries of the Huawei watch
- Restart watch
- Restart iPhone
- Bluetooth settings on iPhone>add both Huawei watch options
- Huawei Health app>turn off notifications and turn on 

Messages appear in the app to pair up watch and also receive notifications which I accepted.

Notifications started to appear again on the watch",/r/HuaweiWatchGT/comments/10kbe8b/notifications_issue_gt2ios_163/j5v52ba/

The Huawei health app is really good, it's easy to install new apps on it, it works great with Apple music which I use on my android device, I can control volume and track skip, the watch as a standalone unit is great anyway
Quick replies to what's app messages is cool. Weather, compass, altimeter, etc all work really well. Only negative is Google map directions. Petal maps is ok, but not really what I wanted, can only get it to push directions to the watch when phone is on and unlocked. Just updated to harmony 3 tonight, might be fixed now. I've got no regrets buying it, battery is epic and if you get the pro, it's hard as nails, worth the extra for the sapphire crystal and titanium, I've given it a dozen hard knocks now and it's still like new.

1- I like the little details. Can you answer and make calls with it? Can you use your phonebook on the watch? Can you talk through the watch?

2- Can you start the apple music through the watch?

3- If you have galaxy headphones can you change the mod of headphone with the watch?

4- Is there muscle workout mods in the health app?

5- Does the watch automatically detect the sports or sleep?

jbnh35u,pseudo-nimm1,3/10/2023 1:26,t1_jblt374,11n4mb8,Would you recommend this smart watch?,"Ok. 

1. Yes, and it's super fucking cool. I feel like captain Kirk. 

2. No, have to start it on the phone. Then the controls appear, however, after doing that, the controls do stay for a while and you can invoke it again. Also, pro has 25gb of storage, so you can transfer music directly to it and hook up Bluetooth headset directly to it. You can listen to music without even needing your phone, plus changing the volume with the wheel which is super sexy.

3. No. Have to use gear app on phone. 

4. Ha ha ha, you're asking the wrong weakling. 

5. Yes.

6. Again, Google maps directions, I deliver BMW cars and quite often need walking directions to the nearest train station, petal maps is a let down. Really hoped I could just get directions on my wrist. I'm also looking at getting a Spigen strap as I'm not a fan of the leather one. I'm not 100% comfortable with the water proofing, as there's a mode to eject water from the speaker! It does work though, I'm not sure if I'll wear it for swimming.

Question 2 is no... I think. I do use authenticator, but it doesn't link to the watch. The notifications to I get to from Google to allow login to a browser that come through to the phone don't come through to my watch, but I'm not sure I have them turned on. I'm pretty certain the answer would be no though.

But, if you wanna try it anyway, strongly heat up the display, and then insert slim iron cable (which you can buy from aliexpress) and slowly move it in between display and glass. Also you can help yourself with isopropyl which i suggest.

One last tip. Don't do it, if you are not prepared to buy new display. I've tried it many many times on phone, and was successful only couple of times.

Edit:
If you only have scratches, i suggest you to buy tempered protective glass and revising liquid. Put some liquid on your watch, and then stick tempered glass. Theoretically it would hide scratches and also, you will have protection.",/r/HuaweiWatchGT/comments/11itjb6/replace_glass_only/jb2ihho/

I only have had the watch 2 months, but i use it a lot. Running 3 to 4 times a week and climbing 3 times a week. While rock climbing, i fell twice where the watch face scraped on the wall. It doesn't have a scratch on the watch. I'm really liking the sapphire glass for that reason. Other smartwatches would all be scratched with my use but not a gtpro.

For the features, unfortunately not many apps, i didn't get to try one i like yet. But there are some available, and more will be made. Im going skiing next week and i wanted to try the ski mode, i could update next week if you want. I also wanted to try the route back features when summer comes but i don't want to run too far away from home in winter. 

One drawback for my experience is that the gps sometimes takes long to detect where you are. I heard the watch 3 is faster . I don't let that bother me and start the training anyhow, even if the watch warns me that gps is still trying to locate me. I do that because i find it connect fast when i run as opposed to standing still.",/r/HuaweiWatchGT/comments/10x765t/gt3_or_gt2_pro/j7rvtbe/

But I've used the h10 while using also a pair of jaybirds and some soundpeats too.

When I mesure my bpm with my good old hand it's totally normal (150-160 bpm) so it become obvious that the watch sensor isn't working properly. The only accurate data seems to be when I don't work out...

I had a bit of struggle to make the watch recognise the belt. I restarted the watch multiple times, and it finally worked! Once the belt is registered you just have to reconnect it from the ""registered bluetooth"" menu whenever you want to use it. 

Heart data are now perfect! It worked for a week but I just had to do it all over again today because for one or another reason the reconnection wasn't working today, I hope that it will not be too frequent...

Maybe restart your watch and make sure to have the belt correctly strapped, also be sure to select the type of product on ""cardio Belt"" when associating",/r/HuaweiWatchGT/comments/10pbdnt/cardio_belt_earphone_connexion/j7h4yf6/
j5orbyl,brreaker,1/24/2023 7:55,t3_10jewg0,10jewg0,How is the watch (GT2) now with iOS 16.2,"Mine works mostly fine, I get notifs and calls, sometimes notifications stop coming in so I gotta reboot it. 

The weather doesn't work unless you open the Huawei Health app every couple of hours unfortunately and that kinda bothers me.

The pairing was a bit cumbersome, had to do it a couple of times at first and then it kept working.

Unfortunately iOS is very closed down with outside devices, but I wouldn't get an apple watch mainly because I really like my one week battery life.

Oh, and Find my phone rarely ever works, if that's important for you, at least for me it almost never works.",/r/HuaweiWatchGT/comments/10jewg0/how_is_the_watch_gt2_now_with_ios_162/j5orbyl/

I've been using the watch with iOS for almost 2 years and before that I was on Android. Nothing has really changed from iOS side. The closed nature of the O/S is causing some noticeable limitations when compared to Android. The most obvious is that some features require the Health app to be running on iOS (find my phone, weather sync, no add-on apps etc). I got used to it and it's now not a big deal. This did not worsen over time. In fact things got better, not because of something on iOS side but because the Health app on iOS has evolved. It's features are now almost comparable to the features of the Health app you find on Hua's marketplace and in fact it's actually better than the Health version you get on Google Play store. I would definitely choose this watch again over any other alternative for the large battery time and the robustness of the construction (GT2 pro titanium/sapphire/ ceramic back version).",/r/HuaweiWatchGT/comments/10jewg0/how_is_the_watch_gt2_now_with_ios_162/j67hloy/

I made the mistake of watching a YouTube of the new features as seen on a Chinese watch (although i could swear the guy was in Europe?) - answering messages by keyboard, voice, new watch face effects etc. 

Sadly, uk GT3 Pro w/Android got none of this. I suppose i should be happy with 'lock screen ' and 'torch' from the pull-down menu!

I can only assume they're not gonna add that feature at all considering it's been two years which irks me even more when almost every other wearable brand has added it and there are plenty of comments from people on the site that get the same copy-paste ""your opinion is so important to us we will proceed to immediately print it out and handle it to the shredder team"" comment, or at least from my pov it sounds like that 🤦🏻",/r/HuaweiWatchGT/comments/102z9zj/gt3_keeps_thinking_ive_gone_back_to_sleep/j31iilq/

From what I've seen on the huawei site the customer support answer to false-positive naps and ""gone back to sleep"" data for the past two years has been to take off the watch altogether so it doesn't think you're sleeping during study/work/movie/etc. sessions until they add the option to manually edit the sleep data (but then they've been claiming to pass along the feedback to the appropriate team for two years so at this point I highly doubt the feedback is being used at all).",/r/HuaweiWatchGT/comments/102z9zj/gt3_keeps_thinking_ive_gone_back_to_sleep/j31hyma/

I went for it because of the titanium build and sapphire glass. I had a cheaper watch which got scratches pretty quick so I wanted something that can last with fewer charging. 

The Health app used to show the route I walk with photos I took along the way but it isn't able to show photos along the route now. 

The additional apps are few. Google maps navigation and a few games are all I use. 

My only wish is that I was hoping it had quick replies template to reply whatsapp. 

No regrets. It feels like a watch more because I don't need to charge it every day.",/r/HuaweiWatchGT/comments/100nopn/how_does_the_gt2_pro_work_today/j2maicw/

Another thing, I've read that users in the US have had issues (Huawei ban) and limits apps/watch faces - you can Google more on it.

Latest updates as far as I can tell, and I generally wear it a finger width above the wrist bone and usually so I can slip a finger beneath the strap and inner arm, however I did tighten it more so during this ride.

Following the post I did a quick 2 minute blast and again tracked to the 140s then fell off a cliff until I jumped off the bike then rose to the 160s and maintained there whilst HR gradually fell.

I’m wondering if when it gets past the 140 range it’s some weird anatomical structure / angle of my arm on the handlebars that make it difficult to ascertain the higher rates?",/r/HuaweiWatchGT/comments/zrvz6i/indoor_cycling_tracking/j155ezx/

You can investigate a little further on the topic but essentially you can jave a very huge variation of vascularity from one arm to the other.

Ive found out that left arm is rocking for me while right all tho more comfortable for me,  I get readings of even 10 beats per minute deviated .

Another factor could be sweat and movement letting lots of light from the room you're im.

Something that has helped me a lot is a wrist band that covers the watch from any source of light disturbing HR readings.

You can give it a try",/r/HuaweiWatchGT/comments/zrvz6i/indoor_cycling_tracking/j156vb3/

Correlation value is more than 95% for everything except weightlifting which will drop that to around 90 for lost people

Still pretty good for a wrist based device.

I hope just changing arms fixes it, you can also try nylon bands, those are really good for getting a more tight and comfortable fit",/r/HuaweiWatchGT/comments/zrvz6i/indoor_cycling_tracking/j158q57/

I have just bought a Galaxy Watch 5 Pro but still considering the GT3 Pro. What I really like of the GT3 Pro is the battery and the look. The major ""issue"" with it is the notifications system. Personally, I'm not looking for a smartwatch focussed mostly on the fitness, and that leads me towards the GW5 Pro. On the other side, I don't think I will use much NFC payments or any particular apps present only on the Google Play Store.

I looked for videos and reviews about the last updates on the GT3 Pro and I haven't found any major improvements in the last HarmonyOS version. I usually get notifications from different apps (SMS, WhatsApp, GMail, and mostly from third-party apps) with and without pictures, and I would be able to read them ENTIRELY and dismiss them from the smartwhatch. I'm not sure that the GT3 Pro would allow me to do it now (or maybe in the near future?!).",/r/HuaweiWatchGT/comments/zk0ik9/notifications_management/j0g7xs3/

And one of them, which is amongst the most important ones is indeed how tight you wear the watch, it should be worn up above your wrist bone and really tight in you wrist.

It shoul just barely fit one or two fingers between your skin and the strap, depending on what you feel the most comfortable.

This is not a normal watch which I've seen lost of people wearing them like if they were necklaces, skin tone and skin vascularity are also a really big factor.

Pros of GT3 over Wear OS: 
Battery life is a thousand times better.
The OS is snappy and smooth.
Everything works really well (Wear OS got so buggy that in the end, basic functions wouldn't even work any more).
No ugly fat bezel border.
Skin temperature monitoring.
Price is cheaper.


Cons:
Replying to messages is limited to pre-configurable responses only.
Very limited selection of apps.

Google would need to do another MAJOR overhaul of Wear OS to temp me back. The current version is still miles away from what it should be and if this iteration fails, I can see them giving up.

To be honest, I like better the watch fit form factor for lots of reasons, from comfort on the wrist, weigh, accuracy and battery life, to watching content on a squared/rectangular screen will always be better.

Was very disappointed of the software bugs on the ticwatch. WearOS on ticwatch is far from a good system. Also over all these years I didn't used any additional apps beside the supplied. Didn't use pay features. 

Thanks to Amazon I could give the watch back after 7 month getting back the full price paid. Now I have the huawei GT3 Pro and couldn't be happier. The health features are spot on and it works flawless. 

The only thing I really miss is to make my own watchfaces with the watchmaker app. It was a lot more easy / flexible compared to the huawei software workflow.
I bought some faces instead.

Edit :

The GT watches are sports health watches with a stripped down, less apps available harmonyOS. The watch 3 is a full harmony OS watch comparable to wearOS with an extended app store.

Although *payed* exists (the reason why autocorrection didn't help you), it is only correct in:

 * Nautical context, when it means to paint a surface, or to cover with something like tar or resin in order to make it waterproof or corrosion-resistant. *The deck is yet to be payed.*

 * *Payed out* when letting strings, cables or ropes out, by slacking them. *The rope is payed out! You can pull now.*

And I had Samsung watches from the very first to the S3.

The Huawei OS of the watches is different, by far, it's simpler, that's how they achieve the battery life.

Of the specific GT3 PRO.

- I train daily and use the gps from 30 to 60 minutes daily
- training from 60 to 120 minutes

My battery life is between 8 to 9 days with that usage.

About messages, you can reply but only pre-existing replies. The only watch from Huawei with a full keyboard is the watch 3, and battery life for me is no more than 3 days.

The sensors are amazing for sport tracking, enough for sleeping and plenty.

It has ECG which is a nice extra.

If you want a ton of apps and keyboard, it's not your option, keep in the wearOS family.

I prefer Huawei for the battery life, the hardware (which is gorgeous and great sensors), and the basic functions are more than enough for me (the functions out of the box).

BTW my GT 1 which has 4 years now, still works flawlessly and great battery life.",/r/HuaweiWatchGT/comments/yczen2/questions_for_all_you_huawei_watch_gt_folk/itr40mg/

For replying to notifications i believe you can only reply with quick messages you can type in on your phone

If you do want a good way to reply to notifications, the huawei watch 3 does have a full on keyboard and speech to text which you can use to reply to notifications with, but not for gt3 as far as i know

And also no google apps because of the us ban thing, no google apps at all

It does not have a calender app, but the previously mentioned watch 3 does. However i dont know how that functions and if it syncs with your phone(it might do i just dont know)

The battery life is very good being able to last 14 days and 8 days in heavy use on the titanium version and 7 days casual and 4 days in heavy use on the ceramic one

this is one advantage over the watch 3 i mentioned, bc the watch 3 only has 3 days and the watch 3 pro has 5 days of battery",/r/HuaweiWatchGT/comments/yczen2/questions_for_all_you_huawei_watch_gt_folk/iuocdsr/

I think you could achieve what you want, but as soon as you want to say, open a webpage, or search on some ""unusual site"", that is unavailable because it doesn't have specific functionality.

Personally, at least right now, I am happy with the ""phone tethered"" model, mainly because the other option is paying X amount amount for another SIM and I am against anything that is X amount a month over a one off payment. 

The issue is here, you have this tether, to common activities, and half of them don't work. I am not asking for much, a Map from my phone, even using Petal maps rather than Google maps if needs be, and then a GPS point that the watch can already do, is not much at all to ask for. To that adding different Zoom levels and then navigation would be good, but honestly I don't necessarily care about that, I have a phone for further details, or a dedicated GPS in a car. I would just like a ""Where am I"" function, so I can go, oh right it is 100m in that direction I am nearly there, or the opposite, I have gone past it. 

That is a very needed function of an activity watch if you want to be free to freely go run a different route, you can make a small mistake and it doesn't matter, you just flick on your watch and jog back a minute. Once you have to start getting out your phone opening an app, then putting your phone back into your tiny running shorts pocket, it is a (first world) hassle  that the watch was supposed to solve! You are supposed to flick your wrist and go, opps, it was a bit back there, no loss of stride, or pace, just keep on going.

Same thing occurred when I was in workout mode, I was doing some weight training, then I wanted to set a time for 1 minute, so I could do a 1 minute Plank for core strength. So what do you do? Hold the bottom button and say ""set timer for 1 minute"", and the answer came back saying I needed to stop my workout first? So I can't set a timer while doing a work out?

I also checked the official product page of Fit 2. Only the warmup and stretching are mentioned. Interestingly, the pages of Watch Fit and the Watch Fit New (same as Fit but with NFC and newer FW) feature the 12 animated workout routines prominently.

Were the workouts ever present in the Fit 2? I don't think so. I checked reviews and they too mention only the pre and post-workout animations.

No, to be serious: go to your nearest official HUAWEI repair shop (if available in your country), ask what it would cost. Then go to an independent repair shop and ask what it would cost.



Take the option that seems more reasonable for the service.

Huawei watch gt (which I personally own) is way better for HR data, it does also have the predictions for 5 k marathon etc, and I have found those to be pretty darn accurate, it also has the feature of the AI couch and AI running program for beginner and advanced runners.

I have personally used that feature a lot, and it does work like s charm.

Garmin... Well... Garmin...
It has good battery life and decent HR tracking, from an integration standpoint, yeah garmin will work better, with 3rd party services.

But Huawei does work with strava and adidas running, so its enough for most of people, both will have the ability to load gpx files for runs and so forth.

Forerunner 55 is not even able to store music locally which Huawei gt runner does, so for me, battery life, feature wise, and multipurpose focused, gt runners wins by a good margin.

I have never owned a Garmin device so I don't know much about their advantages over other brands. i.e. I know Forerunner 55 has predictions for marathons and follow the track. But GT Runner also has the same functions plus apparently one of the best heart rate monitors, lactate threshold and music offline.

I agree about the step counter, but this watch's sensor is probably built differently or too sensitive. My old mi band 6 didn't have this kind of issue. I mean, of course no sensor is 100% accurate but at least a good one doesn't over-count 10 times of the supposed value. Today is my off day and I didn't leave the house and I got up just to eat, toilet breaks etc. It shouldn't be 3k steps but it is. It used to be 200-300 with my old watch.

For the buttons I agree, worst case scenario I'll do that. But I think I'll buy a xiaomi s1 active since its button is more indented. If that also doesn't work maybe I'll change my gloves since it's velcro is at the outer part of my hand which makes the accidental button press more likely.

I reaaally reaaaly don't want to give this one back since it's design is extremely good looking. I wish it wasn't suitable for my use.

There is a way to configure the step count in the settings, (or a way to check the accuracy I can't recall off the top of my head) whether to read from the watch,or from the phone app. If you set it to the phone & carry that around in your pocket,it will give you the most accurate actual step count,as it only triggers with leg movement.",/r/HuaweiWatchGT/comments/xmso57/i_have_some_problems_with_my_watch_and_need_some/iq5dvkj/

For Marq 2 would say get the aviator as it will have all the functionality of the Captain.

If original Marq a bit more difficult as not sure they have done on those lines what they have done on the Fenix 7 / Epix / Marq 2 lines where other than a couple of models like aviator most of the changes are cosmetic i.e. virtually all the Quantix/Captain features are now available on the Fenix/Epix and on the other Marq variants.

But would maybe check with Garmin as Epix etc received the boating features after a recent update and would expect the aviator would have too, yet when check Epix spec not showing up there yet so just think the spec isn't yet updated.

It will track sleep (though uses garmin sleep not first beat sleep so not quite as good or quite as detailed), Pulse ox (massive hit to battery and not much point, but yes offers manual - probably best option, during sleep or always on), fitness level - not really in terms of training metrics and analytics it is more limited. Will show rest periods etc.

Training features: [https://www.garmin.com/en-GB/p/pn/010-02120-10#specs](https://www.garmin.com/en-GB/p/pn/010-02120-10#specs)

TRAINING STATUS	  
TRAINING LOAD	  
TRAINING EFFECT	  
TRAINING EFFECT (ANAEROBIC)	  
IMPROVED RECOVERY TIME

As you seldom run and with no HRV status you are unllikely to be able to trigger training status - but with your edge you may be able to work around that using physio true up (or whatever they call it now) and base it off a cyclig vo2max instead (which FR245 doesn't offer -unless they haven't updated that spec). But even if you don't trigger training status you can still determine your overall fitness levels via training load: [https://www.garmin.com/en-GB/garmin-technology/running-science/physiological-measurements/training-load/](https://www.garmin.com/en-GB/garmin-technology/running-science/physiological-measurements/training-load/) in how that optimal band (second picture -the large lighter green band) is moving up/down or flat; and of course you get training effect to show impact of each trackd activity and you get suggested reocvery time (how long until body rested enough to provide another max effort benefit).

Would suggest reading DC Rainmakers review, if you haven't already, to make sure it fits all your requirements: [https://www.dcrainmaker.com/2019/04/garmin-forerunner-245-music-gps-watch-in-depth-review.html](https://www.dcrainmaker.com/2019/04/garmin-forerunner-245-music-gps-watch-in-depth-review.html) (ignore the music section as your offered watch isn't a music version).",/r/GarminWatches/comments/11qhr2t/tips_on_a_garmin_watch/jc663et/

Re Calendar you will need to link your calendars to Garmin, but once done they flow through without any issue (have no problems with about 6 google calendars) - though your review of details is limited to a minium of around 6 events (depends on how much detail). I can click through to see most of the detail of each event. If have more than 6 on one day you may not be able to see all the events for that day, though as they clear through the day you can then see more. Currently I can see events up to 21st  and generally have 2-3 events on most days (and that includes one event that has full connect details including links etc - though can't click on them - read only).

You could do the same with a venu 2, however battery life isn't as good and doesn't provide the same level of fitness features and or training metrics and analytics or sensor connectivity that the FR265 offers, plus its on the older non dual band GNSS chip so isn't as accurate.

Instinct 2 offers most of what FR265 does, but no touch, B&W screen, Casio G-shock styling, but much much longer battery life (also no offline music, though does have golf).

Tracking is up to 16 hours assuming you use auto-mode (unless in super challenging are best option - but only a 2 difference anyway): so 6.25% per hour (this may also be with AOD off during tracking - so only shows when wrist gesture is used). 

So overall max daily usage for you is probably around 10-11% - which should easily give you a week between charges with a bit to spare. Note that he is seeing more favourable battery when tracking so you might get more out of it. 

If AOD on, would seem as 4-5 days is pretty solid.

They all offer pretty good health metrics - equivalent of fitbit premium and no additional subscription. You are expected to do a little bit more self identification which is understandable as there are so many factors that can ifluence the metrics that the watch will not know about. All 3 will be accurate in terms of stats, but FR255/FR955 a litttle bit more accurate in terms of tracked distance and actual track as mult-band GNSS.

I find my Shokz (they changed their name) aeropex work exceptionally well with my Garmins. When connected to watch can hear music/audio prompts (no offline music on standard SQ2 or FR255 - note there is a FR265 that is AMOLED version of the FR255 and similar price to the FR955 but unlike the FR255 it has music). Though connecting them to the watch you can hear music - you can answer your calls from your watch which diverts it to your phone (if no headset connected to phone you do have to switch on loudspeaker on phone so can hear or pick up phone) - but can answer/reject/hang up from watch). If on android you can even send quick replies to messages.

The SQ2 I would say is better if you're looking for basic smartwatch functionality with solid workout tracking. It looks a lot like the Apple Watches, people that saw mine thought it was Apple lol.

I switched to the 265S because I've gotten more serious in my running lately and it has the ability to run trail courses that I create on my laptop, has 10x more accurate pacing metrics for when I'm running on the track and is a lighter watch that I barely notice when I'm running.

Since you're not very active currently I think the SQ2 is probably a better fit for you and will be the cheaper option. The 265 is definitely geared towards serious runners imo.

Thanks !,"I am an ultrarunner who runs ultra long distances myself. The Enduro 2 is targeted at people like me. But I still think it doesn't really matter in practical terms. Both watches can already handle as long non-stop endurance events as practically possible. 7X battery can be stretched to 104 hours when using GPS only with every second update and always on display - I've just verified that by creating a power profile in the power manager. If someone does backpacking in a remote area, they would very likely also bring their phone or a satellite communicator for emergencies, and those devices need to be charged far more often, so a large capacity portable battery or a solar battery would be required anyway. The watch doesn't take that much time or energy to fully recharge, so in my opinion the extra capacity that Enduro 2 has on top of the already huge battery life of Fenix is mostly a gimmick - it hardly changes anything in practical terms. Garmin has released Enduro 2 mostly to make the specs competitive with Coros Vertix 2.

But getting back to watch comparison like you said it does take up some extra battery having a built in brighter flashlight but that’s where the extra battery comes in. I just feel like it’s a better watch altogether because of that . And it’s cheaper , which is a win win . Another way they achieved more flashlight ability is just by taking the tiny off of the flashlight lens , I’m not sure actually if it’s a different light , I will have to look into that when I get home.

Comparing to Training Peaks you effectively want to look at your 7 Day Load (now called acute load on current watchess): [https://www.garmin.com/en-US/garmin-technology/running-science/physiological-measurements/training-load/](https://www.garmin.com/en-US/garmin-technology/running-science/physiological-measurements/training-load/) you see the picture on the right - that is pretty much the same as how the training peaks work - you have your optimal band as long as in it you are doing good - temporary dips under/over are fine. If optimal band is flat - maintaining; increasing - improving; decreasing = recovery/detrianing. Can see this on the app by going into performance stats - training status - load - and then click on the acute load tab.  (similar for on the web).

Garmin also offers Load focus - wheter your efforts are anaerobic, high aerobic or low aerobic - idea is to keep them balances (unless focusing on a specific event) - by keeping balanced work on overall fitness and help reduce chance of injury. So if looking to train and have shortage of low aerobic, and your 7DL/Acute load is upwards and high  might be a good idea to train in a zone 2 or lower HR zone to get a recovery/base effort.

And you get the training effect of that particular tracked activity i.e. aerobic score and anaerobic score and overall benefit i.e. low/high aerobic or anaerobic (so factors into load focus).:  [https://www.garmin.com/en-US/garmin-technology/running-science/physiological-measurements/training-effect/](https://www.garmin.com/en-US/garmin-technology/running-science/physiological-measurements/training-effect/)

Are you starting to see how much more advanced and how much more complex the Garmin training eco system is - then consider that health metrics like sleep, hrv (stress) can also factor into some of these metrics and into some of the fitness features and you start to understand how much more complex and advanced the system is (and its pretty much all on your watch too!).

It is well worth reading through all of these support articles (full list here) - would read the Health Science, Running Science, Cycling science (there is a lot of duplication), and wearable Maps  sections (read the golf section too if you play) to get a better idea of what the watch offers and how it all fits together. Note that the F6 Pro has most of these features but not all of them, and some may be slightly different.

[https://www.garmin.com/en-GB/garmin-technology/running-science/physiological-measurements/](https://www.garmin.com/en-GB/garmin-technology/running-science/physiological-measurements/)

(for example it doesn't have training readiness and probably will never get it, though this really just brings a host of metrics all under one quick easy score to review).

Note that if you are also over training you will start to see the effect of that in your Stress Health metrics as well as your training status. With the addition of HRV status the training system now does an excellent job of picking up when I start to strain my body.",/r/GarminWatches/comments/11q6ldl/garmin_vs_suunto_interface_for_stress_tracking/jc1qsca/
jc1tjc3,RangeEnvironmental12,3/13/2023 5:53,t1_jc1qsca,11q6ldl,Garmin Vs Suunto interface for stress tracking,"The requirements that Garmin sets to track your training strain is a bit ridiculous. I mean Polar offers most of it with basic watches, whereas you'll need to get the newest and best from Polar to track it. 

My take on it is that Garmin watches deliver a lot more information than you need. So it'll be important to see which value really matters to you. Training load itself isn't working well for me on Garmin, because I exercise different sports. It may work better it you're mostly running.

Very primitive would just be to look at weekly intensity minutes and increase gradually. You could take the body battery into the equation. HRV is a good metric for overall health tracking, with the detriment of also tracking your private life. If my job is particularly stressful, my HRV will be low, despite I'd still have training capacity. 

Dr. Andy Galpin on the huberman podcast has pretty great and scientific advice on estimating your training load without an app.",/r/GarminWatches/comments/11q6ldl/garmin_vs_suunto_interface_for_stress_tracking/jc1tjc3/

Doing what you are doing, like me does impact VO2max and thus will impact the training system and fitness features, but not training load.

Its always possible to estimate training load/focus/status etc manually - the idea is the watch makes this easy for you, so that you don't have to do. It is also very important to understand that the whole training system is based on an average person looking to improve maintain their health & fitness - it really isn't designed for specific events i.e. ironman/marathon training etc - though with the race widget they are starting to try and move in that direction. But its as lot of pros state - pointless using it for training, but out of season they find it works really well where they are just keeping in form. Don't forget part of the training system is trying to reduce chance of injury - preparing for an event will always increase that risk as you have to push.",/r/GarminWatches/comments/11q6ldl/garmin_vs_suunto_interface_for_stress_tracking/jc1yoh8/

There is also the crossover which looks awesome (and has the new GPS chip).

I think the best option is to go through the summary of the Garmin features: [https://www.garmin.com/en-GB/garmin-technology/running-science/physiological-measurements/](https://www.garmin.com/en-GB/garmin-technology/running-science/physiological-measurements/) are there anything here that would interest you - then match that up with the watch options (Fenix/Epix have them all / FR955/965 has pretty much all of them - rest of models have a variatoin of the features).

Do you want maps for hiking with offline TBT navigation - would that be useful? If so you are looking at Fenix/Epix and or top end forerunner series i.e. 955/965 (can go second hand or last generation for cheaper option i.e. Fenix 6 Pro or Forerunner 945). Maps come with some awesome features like climbpro.

Bugs: The sad fact is that all tech has bugs. When people have bugs/or when features aren't what they like (which they often incorrectly call a bug) then people tend to be pretty vocal. Sure go onto a forum and you might see 20 people posting about an issue (and that tends to be a lot for a complaint) - consider how many people aren't complaining about the unit - pretty small.

I would recommend pairing it with the HRM pro to get more accurate heart rate and running dynamics data. It can also serve as a foot pod of sorts for use on a treadmill if you use one. I've not tried it for that use case since I have a stryd pod but people often complain about garmin treadmill accuracy so the sensor in the HRM pro should help.,/r/GarminWatches/comments/11qagmg/garmin_forerunner_255_or_945_as_they_are_now_the/jc24rn4/

jc64x48,jaamgans,3/14/2023 2:37,t3_11qqe22,11qqe22,FR955 Bands,"QuickFit is garmin's own system where they clip onto thicker watch pins than most other watches offer. Quick release is the standard replaceable watch band system which uses much thiner pins.

Depends on watch bands - the ones for the Fenix series are thick chunky bands and weigh approx 20g - so moving to a nylon hook and loop strap can save around 20g. Part of reason why weights for these watches are given for case and case + strap. So yes they may do, but might not be as applicable for the forerunner serious - you would need to weigh your strap.

No in terms of how far a watch sticks off wrist as can't change case.

Movement during activity - yes - nlyon straps are infinitely more adjustable than a silicon strap that relies on holes set specific distance apart.

Leather/metal strap - great for casual use/office/formal occasions (and part of the reason  why i went Epix/Fenix rather than forerunner as I think the style fits leather/metal better) and natural materials compared to nlyon/silicon.",/r/GarminWatches/comments/11qqe22/fr955_bands/jc64x48/

Deal breaking bugs that I came across:

1. Interval workout bug that totally messes up the workout instructions and the distance recorded once the activity is saved, giving you false PRs, and preventing you from using the feature in future.

The people on the forums are not lying. I can easily replicate the bugs reported over there on my 255.

The flashlight pulled me to the enduro 2 . It’s a great watch my only complaint is the green tic marks . They look good with the right watch face , I recommend the enduro beta face on the IQ store. If your a going to be a heavy user the extra battery really will come in handy , and it comes with some tactical features as well if your into that. Overall great watch , the silicone band is amazing and the Velcro one is comfy , but hard to take on and off. I got a “titanium “ band off Amazon for 50$ with a quick release clasp and the clasp makes the band worth it 100% and matches nice , overall I really recommend the enduro 2 , check out my profile, I post a lot of pics of it !",/r/GarminWatches/comments/11mzknw/fenix_7x_sapphire_solar_enduro_2/jbn2sw5/

The bonus of your nap is that it probably helps settle your body's stress quicker than if you hadn't had a nap. You would only be able to confirm this via trial and error and reviewing against your data - but that is what is great about the garmin system is that you can do stuff like this to work out what works for your individual needs as all our bodies react differently.

What you could try prior to the nap is running a breathing exercise (maybe short focus) - as this can often help bring down stress levels quickly.

jc7vrjl,Lt-Milo-Minderbinder,3/14/2023 11:03,t3_11r53ju,11r53ju,How important is Multiband GPS?,"It really depends on how important you care about your overall speed/distance. If you are running splits and trying to improve your performance, the more accurate GPS the better.

I live in an area with lots of interesting challenges. Sound walls, interference from military bases, a combination of downtown streets and suburban/rural areas, lots of tree cover, etc.

With plain GPS, you get a lot of jumps and issues around anything challenging.

With GPS+GLONASS/Galileo, I've found that your movement is directionally correct, so your speed and pace and location are largely good as long as you are heading in roughly the same direction. It is also good in ""normal"" environments. However, in challenging environments like tree cover/mountains that block your view of the sky on one side/buildings/electrical interference, you start to have ""cutting"" issues. Basically, when you make a turn, the GPS and smoothing algorithm try to figure out your path and end up cutting some of the distance you traveled. I also find you are sometimes 10-15 feet to the left/right of the trail you are on after coming through a challenging stretch and it sometimes corrects a bit over time, adding a little distance on. On net, you might be off a few percentage points on a long tracking event, but more on a shorter one.

With Multi-GNSS or Multi-Track, I've found that for everywhere except in a downtown with buildings on both sides, the tracking is *very* close to perfect. Even in downtown areas, it's close enough to place me on the correct side of the street and follow me as I go.",/r/GarminWatches/comments/11r53ju/how_important_is_multiband_gps/jc7vrjl/

jc7cz3o,jaamgans,3/14/2023 9:06,t3_11r53ju,11r53ju,How important is Multiband GPS?,"Really comes down to how challenging the environment is, but even then its still pretty impressive - check DC Rainmaker comparison:

[https://www.dcrainmaker.com/2022/04/garmin-vertix-accuracy.html](https://www.dcrainmaker.com/2022/04/garmin-vertix-accuracy.html)

""The one interesting caveat is the Fenix 7 base unit (the cheapest one), which, seems to split the difference there. In fact, I think at the right party with enough drinks it could pass itself off as dual-frequency GPS tracks""    --- so in other words while not quite as good not too bad.

Biggest issue would be more around instant pace as this is affected if track not great - but based on what you do I suspect it probably isn't overly an issue for your purposes.

&#x200B;

Note that it isn't just the GPS that is different. Base model also only comes with 16GB of storage - so have to load your map region and can only really hold one depending on your region; its bezel and back case is stainless (so if have nickel allergy this could be na issue) and the its gorilla 3 dx not sapphire. All sapphire versions also include solar.

Maybe also look at the Epix especially if you dont quite need the battery life and are in a more dimmer environment where AMOLED is more user friendly (not sure its the same everywhere but in the UK the Epix RRP price of base and sapphire (no solar) has been reduced). Also the FR955/FR965 which offers most of what the Fenix/Epix offer (see differences: [https://www.dcrainmaker.com/2023/03/garmin-epix-vs-forerunner-965-all-65-differences-detailed.html](https://www.dcrainmaker.com/2023/03/garmin-epix-vs-forerunner-965-all-65-differences-detailed.html) )",/r/GarminWatches/comments/11r53ju/how_important_is_multiband_gps/jc7cz3o/

The Enduro2 is arguably my second favorite now after the AMOLED of the Epix2, but I just can’t get away from the flashlight.

Solar charging on an AMOLED… meh, after seeing the Fenix7 being more of a delay charging tactic than an actual charging modality - I don’t know how valuable that’d be to me since a shower time top up once a week does the trick for both watches. I could see it possibly being useful for long distance endurance activities, but just how truly useful that’ll be on such a power hungry screen… :/ 

Software version 11.28 already nets me 16 days of battery (with SP02 as sleep only) on the Epix2, so even there, I don’t see much for them to improve on.

I personally doubt Apple will ever let Garmin fully into the calls/messages ecosystem on iOS devices, so the entire “smarter” watch functionality on the Venu line is a write off to me and I see no need for LTE/5G chips that’ll only serve to be a battery drain and an extra $5-10/mo in carrier fees.

Everything else can be a wash in my books, but that Enduro2 LED flashlight needs to come to the Epix3 and suddenly we have perfection (imo).",/r/GarminWatches/comments/11nfoxz/so_this_is_what_wealth_feels_like_2x_tactix_7_pro/jbxah30/

Garmin product life cycle is 2-3 years during which it will receive full support - however depends on model as to how many feature updates/improvments it may get, and the instinct is closed watch - bascially - what you buy is what you get nothing else. So was pretty limited in terms of feature updates - but that is all in the past as its past its product life cycle. It may still get the odd bug fix going forward. But that really shouldn't matter based on your use case. As it is so closed what it does today it will still do that for you in 2-3 years time.

jbzgtan,Adventurous_Lack_776,3/12/2023 15:34,t3_11prhpo,11prhpo,Has your fitness watch improved the quality of your life overall?,"\-A fitness watch can give you encouragement like most Garmins will have a 'suggested workout' for the day and this takes into account body battery, sleep score etc. You've also got Garmin coach so you can work towards running a 5km/10km etc etc.

\-Personally I like my Garmin Venu, thinking of upgrading to a forerunner 265 as like the touch screen and AMOLED display. I like it better than an Apple watch as I don't prefer having a miniature phone on my wrist and being dependent on it so much. Also battery life is A LOT longer. 

\-Yes to the wellbeing part, I enjoy being able to do on screen workouts, yoga and connect with friends through the Garmin connect app, challenging each other and being able to interact in general with the fitness community. It also syncs to apps like Strava so you can connect to other people without a Garmin.

\-I find my 2019 Venu to still be very accurate in terms of heart rate, GPS, body battery and just generally everything. The battery life isn't the best - around 3-4 days but still a lot better than competitors like Apple watch or Samsung for its age (and even now, compared to the Apple watch series 8 which features a mere 18 hours battery!). Might be enough for some people, but I've got things to do and people to see :D no time for charging a watch that frequently!  

\-Regarding what model, it depends on your needs. Something like the Garmin Venu 2 would be a great smartwatch and the Venu 2 plus would have a mic and be able to take phone calls with a phone nearby. They are more smartwatch based - Garmin's response to the Apple watch. However, the forerunner series is more focused on runners, it does have full triathlon abilities though and with the new forerunner 265/965, the screen is more comparable to the apple watch/Garmin venu series. If you aren't looking for the best stats and features (or if you are, look to the fenix line or Epix/Enduro) then the vivomove series could be a potential. They are hybrid watches but track basic sports - no build in GPS though, unlike the majority of other Garmin watches.

Last summer, when I had an undiagnosed life-threatening medical condition, my Garmin 255 was highly complimentary about my sleep and other fitness metrics.  Once I started highly effective life-saving medical treatment, my watch started poo-pooing my medical treatment.  It started constantly calling my sleep ""poor"", despite good sleep habits.  And it wants to disparage my best efforts.  For example,  It is not uncommon when I put a whole-hearted effort into a sprint workout, the watch will give me a great Anaerobic training effect and a respectable Aerobic training effect, but it almost invariably gives me a negative Performance score.

The watch is great if I am running intervals.  It does a great job of highlighting the differences between my work periods and my recovery periods, so I can keep my training on target.  These days, I refuse to sleep with this watch on my wrist, but I slip it on when I am going to run.  I hate the fact that the watch has many features that overpromise and underdeliver, but there are a handful of things it does remarkably well.

I went from scratching equations all day long to averaging 16-24km of run per week. But my motivation was and still is more on trying to be fit. I could have done that with just the step counter on my phone, yes. But I like more details, to kinda zoom in on my health, if you will. Not just to track steps or distance I’ve walked or ran. 

In addition, Garmin Coach really helped a lot. My girlfriend and I ran our first 5k race a little over a week ago, and I was able to finish it under 30 minutes. 

Stress level monitoring and body battery for me are quite accurate. It knows when my noisy neighbors from hell are pestering me.

- helped me to train better in other areas e.g. weightlifting. I know the calories burned metric should be taken with a grain of salt but the watch basically helped me understand that my pre-watch era workouts were trash. Now I train harder and better am can gauge the quality of my workouts based on the metrics the watch provides.
- gives me a bunch of sleep stats that helped me dial my sleep in general. I can confidently predict my sleep score without checking the watch and this helps me plan my day and fitness activities. Also, it made me realise how bad alcohol and late nights were for my overall sleep quality.
- helps me deal with stress - I used to have and still have lots of headaches. I was able to correlate them using the stress metrics to various activity patterns and this allowed me to avoid or better deal with them.

Of all the gadgets I used, my fitness watch has definitely been the most useful from a health pov on a day to day basis.",/r/GarminWatches/comments/11prhpo/has_your_fitness_watch_improved_the_quality_of/jc1cylz/
jc1vd1s,SuAlfons,3/13/2023 6:09,t3_11prhpo,11prhpo,Has your fitness watch improved the quality of your life overall?,"Having the statistics on a watch (before Garmin) made me doing sports regularly.

Switching to a Garmin Vivoactive 4, I enjoyed running and biking with a much better (quicker) GPS than with my watch before - so it motivated me to more sports. I did a 10km plan using Garmin Coach and later a 5km plan. Just 3 years ago I thought I could never run 10km, let alone 21 km.

So you can say, having a Garmin has improved my life, it helped me stay motivated for sports and it helped me stay informed about my body and fitness level.

I still run several times a week and watch my pace and heart rate while doing so. But I do not follow a specific training plan right now, thus I do not stress myself with the pace that I achieve. I hardly look at the stress level or body battery or sleep analysis (I know I do not sleep enough).

When it's time for a new watch, I'll likely go with a Forerunner model that has ""Training Recommendation"", I think I can benefit from this kind of proposal that comes without an actual training plan attached. 

I'd prefer to have a MIP screen in the future, too. I do not trust the OLEDs to last as long and I enjoy a truly full featured always on display that you get with the transrefelctive MIP screens.",/r/GarminWatches/comments/11prhpo/has_your_fitness_watch_improved_the_quality_of/jc1vd1s/

I also track my workouts - mostly strenght and some walking. I used to track my walks all the time (with different watched throughout years) but now I do it only when I know I’m putting more effort into a walk or I want to know distance. 

For me the watch is a great motivator BUT you really need to be mindful of your body and still know when you need to rest. It was hard for me for a while, I felt bad when I lost my step streak and often went to get the steps in even when I was sick or way too tired to function and so on. Now I’ce made my peace with it, lol.

I like that the battery lasts more than two weeks.

I like the Training Status; I did a long (for me) run on Saturday and the watch said I was ""Strained"" and showed my Heart Rate Variability was low for four days afterwards, so I felt great taking it easy until it recovered and went back to a Training Status of ""Maintaining.""

Sleep stages are not settled science, when different labs examine the same data sets of a sleep study, they agree on the cycles about 80% the time.  That’s WITH access to brain activity, which the watch can only guess at with actigraphy and heart rate. 80% is a pretty fungible baseline for accuracy and a reason why many sports tech reviewers like Dcrainmaker don’t comment on sleep stage accuracy, just sleep and wake times. 

That said, I noticed that after I started running, I tend to get about twice as much deep sleep as I did before and tend to feel more rested.  So looking at stages can still be useful, if you only use yourself as the baseline.

Support for Germany is only small and totally unknown banks, too. Like two or three of those that would also supply special deal credit cards associated with big box store chains and live off people forgetting to balance their CC account.

My bank, which belongs to the nationwide Sparkasse system, even has their own app for mobile payment. My virtual credit card and banking card (Maestro standard is still offered in Germany and is still the most common card accepted by stores) do not work in Google Play (there is a free work-around Mastercard from PayPal). I need to use the Sparkasse Mobile Payment app. It took years of pressure to make them work with Apple Pay, but Android, they only have their own app. And this is about the same for all major German banks. They support Google and Apple Pay if you're lucky and noone supports Garmin Pay.

In regards to FR945 it was very specfiic. In the Bounce we are starting to see how Garmin may tend to use this functionality going forward.

You have to remember that for Garmin LTE is a very limited use case, compared to Apple and Wear os wtaches - as their eco system isn't designed in the same way and they don't have the level of apps that would push greater requirements for that level of connectivity. And Garmin isn't the only one. Outside of Apple/Wear os, and even in those eco systems very few watches offer LTE functionality as there really just isn't that much point - so why provide when the demand really isn't there. As the demand increases and it becomes a necessity and or more functionality is available - I suspect you will see it on more Garmin's - however for now they continue to test and play with options.",/r/GarminWatches/comments/11s31fw/why_isnt_there_any_new_watches_with_lte/jcch8mf/

If battery life and health, fitness and training more important then Garmin is a better option. To come even close to Garmin  you would need to be looking at the Samsung GW5 Pro. In terms of missing features due to not having a samsung you really only lose out on non-essential ones like Blood Pressure (which doens't work), ECG (1 Lead so reasonably worthless to most people). Wear os can do what you want, however might struggle battery life and the sensors aren't as good as garmin.

V2 & V2P would definitely suite your purposes but are a bit light on the treking side in terms of tracking battery life and the inability to use courses (though you do have a back to start option - though its a complete retrace).

Better as a smartwatch vs the vivoactive 4, crisper screen, newer software and better battery life, and access to the phone's assistant. Animated workouts.

jceunj4,Adventurous_Lack_776,3/16/2023 2:56,t3_11sgmxh,11sgmxh,Looking for a new smartwatch.,"Personally, I'd narrow it down to the 255/265 or the venu series. The vivoactive 4 is good and the price has gone down a lot since it was released in 2019, but it's been nearly 4 years since then so I doubt there'll be a lot of software support if any available now. The vivoactive 4 has the same MIP screen as the forerunner 255 if that's what your preference is. Some say the 265 will experience burn in but most agree with new technology on the AMOLED screens, it's won't be noticeable. The 265 has training readiness if that's important otherwise other than the display, it's virtually the same as the 255, bar from a newer UI and animations/watch faces. The venu series is basically Garmin's response to Apple watches. The Venu 2 plus is the only Garmin watch with ECG and a mic. It's got the same display as the 265, however doesn't have the same technical training metrics. Another option could be the Venu sq 2 released last year, it's basically the smaller sibling of the Venu 2, without mic and ECG plus a few other features but offers basic fitness metrics - it's a direct competitor to the Apple watch SE some could argue. It does have a square watch face though which some like but others don't. Hope this helps, feel free to ask any questions :)",/r/GarminWatches/comments/11sgmxh/looking_for_a_new_smartwatch/jceunj4/

-wear watch 24/7, including tracking sleep.  
-smart notifications on

Lose about 10-15% a day on average. I don't have any other watch to compare it to, other than my wife's apple watch that is on the charger everyday. It's hard to explain how crisp and beautiful the AMOLED screen is, and I only have to charge it once a week so far. 

Even if that drops to 5 days over the life of the battery, I think I could throw it on the charger everyday while I shower and probably never think about battery level.

I wasn't aware the instinct could follow a course but here we go. Pull up the  activity you want to do to follow the gpx course youve transfered. I'll use Run in this example. Once selected press up button. A menu should be there with an option to select courses. Select the course you want and it should allow you to follow it. If this doesn't work and there are no courses there, try and drag and drop your gpx file directly to the watch via a computer file explorer.

But I'm stuck at the step before: when I send ANY tracks from the phone to the Solar Instinct it seems like they stop communicating.
The file never ""land"" to the watch, if I search for it in the tracks menu it is not there.
Maybe I fu*ked up with permissions? I dunno, I want to try to upload gpx from PC in order to understand if it's a communication problem or something else.",/r/GarminWatches/comments/11pt2yd/issues_sending_gpx_tracks_to_my_solar_instict/jc34itw/

When sending or creating files for your Instinct, keep in mind the following device limitations:   
  
1000 saved locations  
30 courses - max of 50 course points  
200 saved activities  
Unlimited points per fit file (limited only by the storage space available on the device)  
Each GPX  file can contain a mixture of waypoints, routes, and tracks. If the GPX file containing a waypoint is deleted, the waypoint will no longer be available on the device. 

Would suggest maybe setting up a very basic one that only has 2-3 points and checking to see if you can send that through without any issues.",/r/GarminWatches/comments/11pt2yd/issues_sending_gpx_tracks_to_my_solar_instict/jc1np55/

So would suggest rather buying based on that, as you can swop out straps - when buying a new strap you can get the key you need to use to replace straps.  i.e. if you want a pink case with golf bezel - that is sport only option, just as black case with gold bezel is classic only option.

Note: while they are possible to swop out it isn't as quick and easy as quick replace/ quick fit sraps.

Anyways, there are always pros and cons, so probably your best bet would be to list our what your top phone priorities are, do some research to see what fits your parameters, narrow it down to 2 or 3, then go to the phone store of your carrier and test out your top choices before committing to one.",/r/GarminWatches/comments/11oqx87/just_a_rant/jbw7lci/

I've tried reading up on hrv, and specifically what makes it increase. I have not had a huge training load prior to this that I have backed off on that might explain it as a recovery. Initially I was happy to ser an increase, but then it turned ""orange and unbalanced"" and it made me think something bad is going on. 

My watch/garmin connect says to rest if I feel tired, as it could indicate I need some recovery. But I mostly find (googled) that a sinking hrv would indicate the need for recovery or that the body is starting to get sick (for example a flu). So what about increase?

I have not generally felt tired, even though I have been busy since saturday. I do have an autoimmune disease that might mess with these numbers, and I am doing a graded exersice program to get back in shape. It is very low intensity, and I do something every day (walking, yoga, very easy strength exersizes).

jbipry2,jaamgans,3/9/2023 2:33,t1_jbiov2m,11mnqxf,Increasing hrv - possible causes?,"HRV increase is generally associated with increased fitness, and yes when I ramp up my programme I tend to see a HRV increase and my RHR goes down, and my training status turns productive. But what I do is mix in recovery days i.e. every 3 days hit hard and the following morning I see the HRV, RHR and status impacted, then rest/train recovery only for 2 days and see HRV go down, RHR go up and Status go back to maintaining. 

Note that as your HRV status improves it may go into unbalanced, however at some point your baseline will adjust and reflect those new higher (and or lower HRV readings) and as long as they remain consistent you will move back to balanced.

Generally though if your HRV continuously goes up it is suggesting that you may be over training - consider training readiness and recovery time and if all high and if Training status is saying strained would seriously suggest your consider adding in some recovery excercise or even taking a rest day.

Quote: ""Mounting evidence shows a relationship between abnormally high HRV values relative to your personal baseline and functional overreach (overtraining), especially when that overreach is achieved through large amounts of low-intensity physical activity. In these situations, your parasympathetic system is working hyperactively towards the goal of reestablishing homeostasis.""

I have been doing quite a bit more than normal low intensity activity (gardening) and sosial interactions (high stress for me). For me, and the crappy shape I'm in, that could absolutely explain that the body percieves an above average load.

But that's the reason. You worked hard when you got your watch. Your HRV dropped because you were not recovering quite enough. Now you're taking it a little easier.

As for the bit on MIP. They have done it, you can get the 955 or the Fenix 7s with all the things you want.

If you add too much functionality to the 255, those pricier watches become redundant. They have to draw the line somewhere as the 255 will most definitely be one of their lowest margin products (which a company accommodates to gather market share)

Also there is the Instinct 2 and Crossover which are quite new with all the functions as well that are not MIP

Garmin has an extensive range for all need states but like all companies they will reserve some DESIRABLE functionality for the higher price points. Shop lower prices, make sacrifices.

For a similar experience the FR265 offers everything the V2 does (note the V2P as V2P is only one with speaker and mic and can leverage Siri) but way more in terms of fitness and training.

Maps - you can use 3rd party apps on the Garmin IQ store.

Re other workout types the V2 can be better than the native app on the AW, but yes a lot of of that can be resolved with the AW by downloading and using 3rd party apps - though will never beat the fact that for Garmin this is all rolled up into one comprehensive app that covers your health, fitness, workouts, courses, challenges, training etc etc. (the only thing that is a seperate app is the store app).",/r/GarminWatches/comments/11m408b/garmin_venu_2_plus_vs_apple_watch_series_8/jbiqf0n/

jbizqvf,ToblersLaw,3/9/2023 4:46,t1_jbiq3tz,11m408b,Garmin Venu 2 plus vs. Apple watch series 8,That is true. Op asked for how to use Spotify on her watch and that is the official method. Personally I use the phone feature instead of the Spotify feature mostly because it’s easier to ask Siri to play X on Spotify (and then yell at Siri a few more times before she gets it right) and when I first installed Spotify on my watch the volume wasn’t controlable or in an obvious location but after testing to explain to op it looks like that has been updated.,/r/GarminWatches/comments/11m408b/garmin_venu_2_plus_vs_apple_watch_series_8/jbizqvf/
jbizh1u,jaamgans,3/9/2023 4:43,t1_jbivrh9,11m408b,Garmin Venu 2 plus vs. Apple watch series 8,"The reality is that it isn't ""just"" designed as an AW competitor - its also there to go against fitbit and against wear os watches. As a general rule it offers better health than all of them except fitbit, but at no additional subscription. It generally also offers better fitness features, and very few of them them offer any training metrics and analytics natively and that includes the AW (of the few that do - Huawei and Amazfit - there systems are effectively a rip off of Garmin - having been based off prior models that have used first beat metrics and algorithms - but they haven't managed to get it right). Of course AW does have a thriving 3rd party platform that offers 3rd party apps that can cover the  gaps like training metrics which the others don't - however it isn't an integrated platform like the fitness watches offer. 

So while it might not be able to compete from a running perspective due to Apple's recent update (not prior to that it offered more compared to AW's native option) - it is still very competative in other areas like Strength, Yogo, Cardio, HIIT, Golf etc unless AW user goes 3rd party.

So to a degree this whether a venu or an AW is a better watch, may come down to the types of activities the user tracks..and whether they can live wihout AW level of smarts or without Garmin battery. And consider their job and their shift pattern battery life may be a higher consideration than smarts, as while you can use a battery pack to recharge during they day - that may not always be feasible when you need to do a recharge.

Part of the reason I moved to garmin was due to battery life - and while I could manage on a 2 day battery life - it was a nuisance sometimes having to make arrangements to take a 5-15min charge so I wouldn't run out of battery life. Now I charge once a week in a time that is convient to me - and if on the weekend we decide to go for a 7hr hike I don't have to worry about whether I have enough battery life, or organize a 15-30 min time out while waiting for watch to charge.",/r/GarminWatches/comments/11m408b/garmin_venu_2_plus_vs_apple_watch_series_8/jbizh1u/

I upgraded after about 1.25 years but mostly because my base watch (VA4) got me off the couch and I ended up running a ton.

What you can do is swop out the silicon strap as the fenix ones are really heavy and add in a lightweight nlyon hook and loop strap as they only tend to weigh around 3g, and as the F7s case is 47g - would put you in at around 50g and not much heavier than your 735xt.

Just to be perfectly clear....ANY IRREGULAR RYTHM is going to show as AFIB on ALL galaxy watches regardless of whats going on such as tachycardia or brachycardia etc, but mine was an extra premature beat now being treated with a medication.  I wouldn't chance it and get yourself checked out.  There are many examples of people who have saved their own lives through this Samsung ekg feature and then going to their doctor or ER. See if it's repeatable, or intermittent as mine was and save or print out the ekg to show your doc. It's no joke. I had an ekg in the doctor's office which showed the exact same signature as my watch and although this was almost 3 years ago using my GW3...the docs were amazed with its accuracy compared to a multi lead ekg.",/r/GalaxyWatch/comments/11ojvhz/it_was_nice_knowing_you_all_good_bye/jbt1ef4/

FWIW, I've tested HR during a medical stress test and it was on point.  Same for the sleep features.  It regularly picks up when I am having cardiac issues, however the reporting can be inaccurate.  For example, PVCs (extra heartbeats that don't fully contract) will show as AFib.  Also of note, and this is with ALL bloop pressure and pulse machines, PVC's can significantly impact the perceived heart rate.  For example during severe PVCs (very uncomfortable) my pulse will read in the 30s.  The pulse machine is not picking up on the ""misfires"".  

Don't worry too much but definitely mention it to your doctor, as they can easily check it out.  Also, if your doctor/hospital system uses something like Epic MyChart, you can upload all of your watch data there.  I regularly upload my watch reports (HR and sleep), along with my blood pressure machine readings.  I feel this is trend is going to be hugely beneficial as AI accelerates in medical technology and can be a wonderful diagnostic tool.

So far, I had one actual aFib event, and a couple of other irregular events, but nothing serious except for one day when my resting heart rate was 129 bpm (made the mistake of strenuous exercise the day after a colonoscopy.   I was properly scolded by the cardiologist and his nurse and will not make that mistake again).

He was curious about the accuracy, so had me do one on the watch at the same time as an actual EKG.  The first few seconds as the watch ""settled in"" didn't match the real EKG, but the rest of it was virtually the same.  He was impressed enough that he is going to recommend WearOS, Fitbit, or Apple Watches to his patients with more serious concerns than mine (mine he thinks was a combination of errors and bad luck and nothing actually wrong with my heart, although we'll monitor for a while).",/r/GalaxyWatch/comments/11ojvhz/it_was_nice_knowing_you_all_good_bye/jbvqlko/

Good bye,"Oh they know that part is true because I used to come into the clinic for my POTS which is postal orthostatic tachycardia. I passed out when they gave me the tilt table test so I'm on a bunch of drugs to try to regulate my heart rate.

And even that day's intake BP measurement was low of 67/44 with pulse about 155 sitting still and he didn't even comment on it despite me being on 3 BP raising drugs. What happens is my BP drops and my HR goes up to compensate. I bought the Galaxy Watch 5 to catch if I pass out and call my emergency contacts so all these other features were pluses. 

The way the PA was acting, I really think he was lying about finding the results. When he came in the room he couldn't look in my face. He kept saying some bs about the results were in one system but not accessible by MyChart, the online system I can access. And how he couldn't even print a copy like I requested.

\- There is no 24h format

\- Steps bar could be interactive, similar to the battery one

\- It would be nice if one could change the colour of those 3 stripes

\- I'm missing a heart rate compilation (not a shortcut). Perhaps, it could be placed at the very bottom

\- I would experiment by trying to make the time pie a bit bigger by reducing the top part's space

\- The size of the lowest complication is a bit odd. It's not big enough for some suggested choices and too small for others.

Also, I tested this on GW 5 Pro

Edit: found a way to change the colour of the stripes/minutes (just press it). Quite an unusual way though. Perhaps I would add it to the customise settings",/r/GalaxyWatch/comments/11odm88/i_want_your_feedback_on_my_watch_face_just_got/jbt6ay0/

Could do with a 24h clock option.

Here are the things I want to hear from you:  
1. Does the Always on Display work as it should? I got error messages about AOD in the WFS software. I personally don't use AOD, so not sure what to expect.  
2. Can you tap to change the color of the stripe at the top, minutes, and left ring? The color should change when you tap each touch point.  
3. Does the step counter work, the max fill should change based on your step goal. The problem is sometimes the goal is fixed to a certain amount.  
4. Any issues with complications? Known issue: (but unknown solution lmao) the complication boundary is kind of weird always rectangular.  
5. I only have Watch 4, so if you have a newer or older model, please let me know it if works. (Eg. the scaling, and positioning of elements.)  
6. Other feedback will be highly appreciated

jcd5h5a,FireNinja743,3/15/2023 16:46,t1_jcd476z,11rjgx2,Happy Pi Day!,"Interesting. My watch is at 43% now, and I took it off the charger at 94% around 12:45 AM. I've been walking around and biking throughout the day to get to my classes, and with AoD on after I woke up around 8:30 AM. I turn my watch on battery saving mode before I sleep and turn it back on when i wake up. So, given that, I get about 17.5 hours of battery life for every ~50% of battery in my specific use case, which is enough for me as I can charge it when I get back. It's interesting how your battery life is much lower. However, I think it may be that your watch is the celluar version, and you have data roaming active all the time rather than using Bluetooth only when connected to your phone? Having celluar always on will drain the battery quite a bit. That's why I just got a Bluetooth/WiFi version for the Galaxy Watch 5 because I'm always with my phone. But, if you don't have the celluar version of the watch, I'm not sure what the issue is.

Fyi, I wouldn't recommend getting anything Tizen based. It has be abandoned by Samsung, and won't be getting updates.

On Samsung health, why can't I see total calories burned through exercise for the day, and total distance walked/ran for the day? Yah I can see it in the ""Steps"" section but that includes my steps going to the bathroom. In exercise it shows total calories burned for the week, but not for the day through exercise. It takes me about 15mins to/from my running spot which I use as a warmup/cooldown. I set my watch on walking exercise during that time. Then set it to running when I start running. 

The app can be more fluid. If I'm checking my workout today on my phone, I should be able to swipe right to go back a day rather than going back to select yesterday's workout. It would make it easier to compare workouts quickly. This can be done on the zepp app and Garmin connect app. 

Also, there should be an option to keep the watch screen on indefinitely during workouts. Yes I can see the AOD of the workout but there's a delay. I'll be pushing it on a run and I'll see it says 135bpm on the workout AOD then when I flip my wrist it'll take a second to update and show me in actually at 165bpm. 

I use a Garmin cycocomputer on my bike, and I'm able to customize my screens, and even add more screens. Also I can create custom intervals. I'd like that option. 

As I'm getting more active thanks partly to the watch, I'm realizing that I need an *actual* sports watch. Thanks Samsung lol.",/r/GalaxyWatch/comments/11mn3ld/galaxy_watch_5_pro_as_a_sports_watch/jbmp2hp/

In the past I've used Garmin Venu 2 Plus, a great (but compared to Samsung expensive) option and also used Apple Watch with my iPhone. Out of all of those, I prefer the Galaxy Watch 5.

[Mine](https://i.imgur.com/xuqLkvX.png) [cycles](https://i.imgur.com/JbUmrcy.png) [through](https://i.imgur.com/RWOufGX.png) a Google Photos album or [Currently Playing track](https://i.imgur.com/B3JPWMS.png) through a combination of the AutoWear ""Large Image 1"" complication, Tasker, and Google Photos API. If media is playing, the notification thumbnail becomes the background. If no media, the background changes every 30 minutes to a random image from a Google Photos album.

There are 4 other AutoWear complications in use in conjunction with Tasker and additional apps.

1. Calendar - using CalendarTask to pull data. If no events are occurring within 24 hours it instead displays the date.

2. Weather - using an older OpenWeatherMap API based project that I found on Taskernet. Main reason for a custom complication here was to add chance of precipitation as a ranged value

3. Phone battery - using phone battery info from Tasker for the ranged value. When nothing else is going on it just displays a phone and battery percentage. If I have an upcoming alarm within the next 8 hours that time is displayed. If I have Bluetooth headphones connected the phone battery text is dropped and substituted with a speaker and percent value, while the ranged value is still phone battery.

4. Currently Playing track/Important notifications - This pulls info from a few different Tasker Profiles related to Currently Playing track, AutoNotification intercepts for particular people/group messages, ANotif intercepts for my kids' daycare app.

My primary goal with all of this was to make my watch something to glance at rather than something to constantly interact with in a distracting way...

I've never tested it for 24 hours... I'm away from my phone for and hour each day when I go on 2 half hour walks. I put it on every weekday morning around 6:30 am then take it off around 10:30 pm to put it on it's charger. I'm usually at 45-35%. I use AOD at work, then turn it off and use raise to wake at home.

Listen, oh won't believe. I also had a success rate of about 50-60%, then u read the manual and since then it works 2 months straight for more than 30 interactions with 100% success. 

Do you know what the issue was? I didn't know where the NFC sensor is. I assumes it's in/on the middle, so I hold my watch screen to the Terminal and NFC symbol and very often it didn't work. 

The sensor it at the top of the watch!!! So you have to hold the top of the watch to the terminal/NFC icon. Once I learned that, I use it correctly and it works flawlessly every single time. I even check animations and graphics... and they'll show it that way too 😅 

so in the end it was a user issue and because we don't/didn't/never read the manual 😂 [here some pics for reference ](https://i.imgur.com/TCGkROp.jpg)

I'm not sure if this will solve your issue. But it did for sure solve mine 😄 good luck and report back 😊

**PS:** it also makes sense, that you can see/read the screen and what's on it while you pay. Before I knew, I also sometimes accidentally used the wrong credit cardy 🙈 I guess that's also a reason for the NFC sensor placement at the top 🤔",/r/GalaxyWatch/comments/11q9hsb/samsung_pay_works_50_of_the_time/jc29cmi/

If you're in the US, check AT&T or TMobile and then if it has a cheaper service thru a 3rd party like Wing Alpha that does support watches. 

If you're after number sync, check your carrier, as some like AT&T require a Samsung phone for initial setup.

The watch is cool, I received mine (Watch 3) for free and before having it I thought it completely useless, but trialling it for a month proved it otherwise, it is tremendously useful and lessened my phone use for small utilities. So I would go with the watch if I had to choose between the 2.

Some of the surprisingly useful features: flashlight, remote control for photo taking, quick timers when doing stuff around the house, showing google maps directions from my phone to the watch so I don't have to pull it while running or traveling, quick music switching, running trainer, sneak peak at SMS for sites that use that as 2FA, find my phone.",/r/GalaxyWatch/comments/11q64sj/galaxy_watch_4_or_galaxy_buds_2/jc1n1ya/

Hello, this is Bing. I found some web results that might help you find the best watch face for a blue and red strap.

According to one source1, some of the best watch faces for a blue and red strap are:

MD123 by Matteo Dini, which has a blue and red bezel and a black dial with white markers.
Sporty Classic by Bergen, which has a white dial with blue and red accents and a date window.
Blue Chrono by WatchMaker, which has a blue dial with red hands and subdials.
Another source2 suggests that blue is the most versatile watch face color, as it is both sober and commanding. It also says that blue watch faces have a rich horological history and tradition.

A third source3 provides some examples of how different colors of watch straps can match with different colors of watch dials. For example:

A navy blue strap can go well with a white, silver, or black dial.
A red strap can add some contrast to a black or gray dial.
A light blue strap can complement a blue or white dial.
I hope this helps you find your ideal watch face for your blue and red strap.😊",/r/GalaxyWatch/comments/11mrgtd/what_are_the_best_watch_faces_for_a_blue_and_red/jbjw2ta/

>Better exersise support

I'm curious about this one--I have bounced around between fitbit, wearos (ticwatch pro 3, galaxy watch 4), and garmin (venu 2 plus), and having come back to my galaxy watch 4, I think samsung health and exercise tracking on the watch isn't deficient in my opinion between fitbit and garmin trackers.  And relative to my garmin watch, I find the ability to customize workouts is better--like for example the ability to customize a running interval exercise directly on the watch and you can skip an interval if desired etc.

>proactive health monitoring

I'm not disagreeing with any of this, but what sort of things?  It already can measure/infer things like blood oxygen and stress.  It measures VO2max from exercises, which is used to infer aspects about health.  Other things that can be used for health monitoring require the watch to be interacted with in a non-normal way, like for blood pressure the watch needs to be quite tight (and also frequently calibrated), and ECG or body composition, you have to interact with the watch.

I'm not sure what other things could be done--temperature monitoring maybe, to infer impending illness?

>create calendar events

running: running power, loops support, vo2max trend over the time, race against yourself (AW has many of them)
hiking: better elevation data (for example, total collected gain), map during hiking (for non pro users), trail mode for longer hikes
gym: for gym shealth is basically useless, it must close gymrun functionality.
walking: vo2max history
treadmill: adjust step length or ran distance based on machine data
gamification: more badges, more interesting global challenges.

swimming: better e2e logic support (currently one needs to switch water mode on/off several times), support swimming with a ""desk"")
I remember complaints about cycling and ski support as well.

proactive health monitor: not just measure stuff, but inform me if patterns are changes (for example resting HR becomes higher than before, or skin temperature), and do cross analysis (bad sleep + higher temperature or so), inform me if o2 dropped during the night without forcing me to open this screen manually, show ""actual sleep"" history and so on. provide something like a body battery. AW does part of these things, Garmn does another.

calendar events probably can be done using GA, but this is a workaround. One does not need to use a voice to create/edit a calendar event.

I strongly believe a daily digest: weather, calendar, sleep quality, body battery + recommendation to take a rest day (if it looks like needed) and some other detected potentially important things will be a great feature.

AFAIK you can't set custom warmup and cooldown, which is really important.

jbknox5,exclaimprofitable,3/9/2023 11:54,t3_11mzn9i,11mzn9i,Hello,"Did you swim in freshwater, or in chlorinated/salt water? If it was the latter, did you rinse your watch afterwards? Hopefully you haven't gotten any soap into the watch as well?

Waterlock is just a software feature, it doesn't magically make the watch waterproof. It blocks unwanted touches on the display, and tries to blow water out of the speakers after you disable it, this is all it does.

The watch is not super waterproof, 5atm is the bare minimum you can get for swimming, because it is certified when standing still in water, but because you usually move in the water you are exerting 5 or more atm of pressure against the watch.

Waterproof seals also age in time and can fail, but certain things for example chemicals make it a much quicker process, such as chlorine, salts, certain things found in some soaps etc.

What can you do? Dry the watch out completely over a few days, most likely it will work again, if you followed the proper swimming etiquette outlined in the manual, and somewhat parroted by me in this long post.",/r/GalaxyWatch/comments/11mzn9i/hello/jbknox5/
jbll141,2Busy2Reddit,3/9/2023 15:26,t3_11mzn9i,11mzn9i,Hello,"Pro tip attempt to get the water out rather than just wait for evaporation as that is more likely to leave residue. Rice or anything else hydroscopic will help. Wrap the watch in, e.g. tissue paper or kitchen towel (to avoid dust getting in the watch), hydroscopic material outside of that. 

I've rescued many completely non-waterproof electronics this way in the past.

Of course if you think there is any moisture inside - power it off for this time. Moisture can condense at settle across contacts. So placing it in a warm (not hot) location will reduce the possibility of condensation without speeding up evaporation.

Good luck",/r/GalaxyWatch/comments/11mzn9i/hello/jbll141/

From 1st January 2023 to 15 February 2023 based upon my Calories in v calories out taken from my Fitbit logging I have had a deficit of 76703 calories which should equate to a predicted weight loss of 21.9 lbs based on 3500 calories being 1lb.

Actual loss has been 24.2 lbs over the same period.

I figured out that it was off last summer. I opened up Excel and input all of the calories burned information for every day for a month or maybe two months. I can't quite remember for how long. So that was one column. 

Next to that column I put all of the calories consumed information for the same time. I was keeping meticulous records and putting everything into fitbit. Then I subtracted the burned from the consumed for each day to get a daily caloric deficit.

On average, we have to burn 3,500 calories to lose 1 lb. According to what I was calculating in excel, I should have been losing almost 1 lb per week. However I was only losing about a quarter of a pound per week. 

I knew that the column with the consumed information was very accurate. I double checked my weight, height, age, and sex information in Fitbit to make sure that those variables were correct, and they were. So there's something wrong with the way Fitbit is calculating the burn rate. At least for me.

You could do something similar if you keep good records on what you consume. And then you could figure out how wrong your burn estimate is, if it's wrong at all for you.",/r/fitbit/comments/11rwy5z/calorie_burn_accuracy/jcat1gq/

try also to not do funny or entertaining stuff before bed (like watching youtube videos), don’t try to stress you out to get some sleep because if you focus on the fact that you can’t sleep you will enter to an endless loop of “i have to sleep, it’s late but I can’t”.

like I don’t avoid any types of foods or eat only 900 calories a day, nor do I binge eat and then induce vomiting to offset the binge eating

I simply try to eat no more or less than my maintenance budget, which doesn’t really fit the description of any eating disorder I looked up, I guess other specified eating disorder is the one I have if I have one

sticking to 1879 calories is easy, and I’ll eat more calories if that’s what I need to maintain a weight of 135, the reason I haven’t yet increased my calorie intake beyond 1879 daily is because I don’t want to increase it to say 100 more a day and then turns out I am now eating too much and then gain 15-20 lbs",/r/fitbit/comments/11tcmk3/got_fitbit_because_my_doctor_was_concerned_about/jcixsnz/

Is it something that interferes with you enjoying your life. Do you spend most of your time reconciling 2 contradictory app and a gadget?

Did your doc tell you something along the lines of stay within this calorie range and exercise at least x amount of time y times a week?

Even a professional could not calculate it that precisely. 

Even responding to general advice to speak to an actual living professional you obsess about these numbers.

Things I am certain of:
*fitbits are inaccurate and unreliable (compared regularly to actual medical devices)
*there are people that develop or experience an increase in health anxiety from use of a fitbit
*a doctor is way more qualified than an app and a watch
*It's pretty impossible to get such specific numbers as you are reporting.
*every single person over 40 that is a healthy weight I know simply has developed a habit of portion control, a preference for healthy food, and leads an active lifestyle.",/r/fitbit/comments/11tcmk3/got_fitbit_because_my_doctor_was_concerned_about/jcizej4/

Keep the arm on the handles, you get no steps. It will pick up on your heart rate increase and give you credit for burning calories, but no steps.

I ordered an ankle band for fitness trackers from Amazon, and it’s nice and sturdy, holds the tracker in a mesh pocket, counts the steps but so far, I haven’t been able to get it in the right spot to accurately measure my heart rate. Registers as much lower than it actually is.

The Charge 5 does not track distance for elliptical, nor does it let you manually enter a distance based on what the machine says. It does track steps if your arm moves enough. Mine tends to count fewer steps for an intense session on the elliptical than it does for a much less intense walk outside, so I'd say it's under counting steps, even when I use the arm thingies on my machine.",/r/fitbit/comments/11t4im1/will_the_charge_5_track_distance_ran_on_a/jcipkhs/

The Garmin is so good, it picked up the change in heart rate while I was doing interval training of 1 minute all out to 2 minutes going easy. Here’s the chart of one interval workout.

First step towards healthy weight.","Nutrition is the most important part of weight loss (and I would argue, for health in general.) Physical activity is INCREDIBLY important, but “you can’t out-train a bad diet.”

And where the calories you consume come from is also super important. A vegetable heavy meal with a lean protein vs a snack of cookies or other “treat” of the same kcal will have a much different result to your body composition and just how you FEEL overall. (When I cut back my sweet treats to almost none, I had a flat stomach for the first time in my life. I also had more energy and less brain fog.)

It’s also ill advised to “eat back calories” burned during exercise. Fitness trackers/treadmills/etc. are notoriously bad at estimating ACTUAL calories burned. I believe I’ve read they’ll overestimate by as much as 40%? But don’t quote me on that. 

Tracking and being mindful of calories in/out is an EXCELLENT first step at realizing what and how much you’re putting in your body. Coupled with a calculator that tells you what you should PROBABLY be eating based on your age/height/weight/fitness level, you can make healthy changes see real results both on the scale and in the mirror. 

I also recommend using a food scale (at least in the beginning) because “guesstimating” how much your eating is another great way to misjudge and accidentally over eat. 

Oh, and don’t forget the importance of protein. You need protein to build new muscle, and more muscle = more calories burned just by existing. There are calculators to estimate how much protein you should be eating as well. (Harvard Health says 0.8 g of protein per kg of weight.)

TLDR; a healthy diet is most important for weight loss. Weigh your food for accuracy. Don’t eat back calories burned during exercise. Fitness trackers usually overestimate Carrie burned. Don’t skimp on your protein consumption.",/r/fitbit/comments/11onvep/its_not_perfect_or_healthy_but_its_not_over_2000/jbx5z23/

Both complimentary to body relaxation and sleep. I could go through the whole human biology of each but it would be easier just to read up or watch.

I'm rxed Clonazepam and I feel mag glycinate gives me a more longer sleep than a tranquilizer that knocks you out.

Also, sleep environment is very important myself. I sleep hot so I have to sleep in a 60's room. It's said that the cooler you're sleep environment, the lower your bp can get to a comfortable feel. 

Some people take hot showers before bed that dilates you. Why some take cold showers in morning which constricts and stimulates for the day.

Melatonin is tricky as the hormone can become dependent. 

Also try to figure out your best sleep cycle. Try different bed times and wake up times.

You can usually prevent it by changing one or more of those variables.

The easiest is to simply wear the band a bit looser when you're not exercising. Next is to swap the arm you wear it on every 12 hours or so. Your skin wants to be able to dry out. If your fitbit traps moisture in your skin, there's a good chance that bacteria will grow and produce burn-like results, including a feeling of sensitivity and heat.

I've never had problems with fitbits/smart watches, but I also:

* Rinse the band/contact every day
* Swap the band to the opposite arm for at least a few hours after exercising
* Swap the band to the least-used arm while I sleep
* Avoid letting soap get between the contact and my skin, including taking the band off for a couple minutes if I think soap",/r/fitbit/comments/11p2ih1/charge_5_burned_skin_bother_with_another/jbvxsgc/

The issues with Fitbits (or any wearable, really) producing burns is from battery malfunctions. The resulting burns are from very distinct evens where the fitbit heated up quickly, produced a first degree burn (there may be some cases where it was second-degree, but I didn't research it, and from the photos I don't have the training to judge), and then the user quickly removed the fitbit and had a mostly non-functional fitbit.

The number of fitbits that had battery problems was concentrated in a few models, and even then were very unlikely (a fraction of a percent). So, if it was an actual burn from a battery malfunction, then its very unlikely you'd experience it again. It would have nothing at all to do with ""thin skin"" as the burns received are the same as pressing your arm against a hot pipe or 

Most notably, the vast majority of those burns came from the Fitbit Ionic, Fitbit's highest-tier (and largest) full smartwatch ... and the one with the largest battery and highest power draw.

Our heart is run on electrical impulses, and AFib is basically when the body’s pacemaker goes out of whack and messed up our normal heart beat that bring blood from chamber #1 -> Chamber #2 -> out to the body.

No warnings is very good!

My guess is that it depends on how sophisticated the sensor is, if it’s an actual ECG then I think it wouldn’t measure it, as an ectopic beat is an extra or missing, but normal, heartbeat, whereas an arrhythmia is a bad heart beat that fails to properly pump blood.  

But if the Fitbit is measuring some less less sophisticated, like blood pooling in the tiny veins in our wrists, it may have issues differentiating between ectopic and arrhythmic heartbeats! Fingers crossed the setting works for you, especially when ectopic beats can be a risk factor for arrhythmias, so you don’t want to get spammed by useless notifications and potentially miss a useful one haha",/r/fitbit/comments/11qrsp1/does_this_mean_no_heart_rhythm_changes_were/jc504a5/

I get these here and there, sometimes quite a few. But I had a shit ton of recently, like every 10 seconds for a week straight, and the fitbit didn't find anything. It was the reason I turned on these notifications, and I got no notifications.

Had my heart checked out after that and it's perfectly fine looking on a 2 day ECG monitor. Doctor doesn't seem to be concerned whatsoever. Just talked about it probably being a nerve thing. I am quite an anxious person. But I do mad cardio all the time without dropping dead and have a resting heart rate of like 50. So I guess, shit happens.

Without nerves connected like after a transplant, hearts beat on their own at roughly 100 bpm and don't react to exercise much. But they run lower and react nearly instantly with nerves controlling them. And things like coffee are known to cause palpitations. So nerves alone can make a perfectly normal heart do wild shit. 

Just to alleviate some anxiety. Which, hilariously, can also cause palpitations.",/r/fitbit/comments/11qrsp1/does_this_mean_no_heart_rhythm_changes_were/jc5diku/

When I hover over my chart I can see it jumps from 1:59 am to 3:00 am. That is good.

**The bad**

I needed to adjust my wake up time (it logged 7:30 am but I woke up at 8:45 am). When I log “sleep end” as 8:45 it sets it to 7:45. I tested this several times and it always sets it minus 1 hour. I can’t log 9:45 to get the correct time because it won’t accept times in the future.

It’s definitely a bug. It’s possible the “old” solution was to just subtract an hour from “sleep end” on DST-start nights.

For the timeseries data where you have measurements every minute it works like this: If the clock gets set an hour ahead you just have a gap of one hour where there are no measurements (because that hour never happened). If the clock is set back by an hour, you actually have two measurements for the same time but with different data (because that hour happened twice). Kind of a mess if you want to do something with the data.

For discrete activity-like data, like sleep, the duration will probably be accurate because the duration is measured in minutes from the start of the activity. But I haven't verified what exactly happens with the sleep stage data which would again be time series.

Traveling to different time zones is also kind of messy. I've read somewhere that they just ""ignore"" time zones as much as they can and everything is simply tracked in the time local to you.

Here's the truth about sleep apnea.  Not breathing while you're sleeping is a bad thing. A really bad thing. Depriving your heart of oxygen for several hours a night is a bad thing. After several years of such abuse, your heart will stop. This is what happened to my ex-wife after years of refusing to use a CPAP machine. Her new husband nudged her to get her to breathe again only to realize that her heart had also stopped beating. Using CPR, he got her started before the paramedics got there. She now has a pacemaker because her heart has been so weakened from not having enough oxygen.

Any reasons for this?","The very frequent awakenings, coupled with you having no memory of it, look like classic sign of sleep apnea. What happens is when you stop breathing during sleep, be it from an obstruction or caused by medication (most commonly but not limited to opioids), your brain senses the lack of oxygen and wakes you up so you start breathing again. These are usually microawakenings, so brief that you’re not consciously aware of them, and there may be far more than what the watch is detecting. Apneas can occur a couple of times over the course of the night or 50+ times an hour (which may be so frequent even your bed partner may not be aware of them even while they’re awake). It’s important to note that sleep apnea can occur regardless of your fitness status or weight; there are elite athletes with sleep apnea. 

I highly recommend you consult a medical professional about this, as well as keep a comprehensive sleep diary that includes the times you went to bed and got up for the day; when and you eat; when/if you exercise and level of effort; any medications (over the counter and prescription) or other substances you consume (legal or otherwise); how many awakenings you remember having (ideally before looking at the sleep stage tracking as that tends to alter our perception of what happened at night); and how you feel each morning when you wake up (be specific, not only if your sleep was good or not, but also note any physical “symptoms” such as a headache, body aches, etc.). The diary along with your sleep tracking can be critical tools for a doctor to use to determine if further testing or a sleep study is warranted and what treatment you may need for something that’s found,

The very frequent awakenings can be a sign of sleep apnea. With apnea, you stop breathing for a period of time either due to an obstruction or a side effect of medication, and your brain wakes you up to start breathing again. These are often microawakenings, so your not aware of them. Sleep apnea can increase your risk for strokes and heart issues. The longer awakenings are also cause for concern, especially if you have no memory of those. You may be sleep walking or you’re still talking in your sleep, those on-sided conversations are animated enough that your watch is assuming you’re awake. With sleep disorders such as these, even the best of sleep hygiene habits aren’t enough to overcome them as they’re outside your conscious control. In any case, you’re not getting much of any restorative sleep during the 8 hour period you’re spending in bed and that alone is cause for concern. Keep a comprehensive sleep diary, noting what you ate and drank during the day and when; any medications, supplements, etc. (legal or otherwise) you consumed; when you exercised and level of effort; and anything else that could possibly be useful for a doctor to review, including observations by roommates, spouses, etc. All of this information can be very helpful in determining what is going on and determining a way forward for any testing and treatment.

While the information from your Apple Watch can be helpful, it's not necessarily a definitive indicator of any underlying health issues.

Regarding your specific question, it's not uncommon to have periods of wakefulness during the night, and many factors can contribute to this, such as stress, caffeine consumption, or environmental disturbances. It's only if you consistently experience significant difficulty falling or staying asleep, or if you have other symptoms like excessive daytime sleepiness, that it might be worth consulting with a healthcare provider.

To clarify, a trend refers to a pattern of behavior or data over a longer period of time. In the context of sleep tracking, this might mean looking at your sleep patterns over the course of a week or more, rather than just one night. By examining trends in your sleep data, you may be able to identify factors that are impacting your sleep and make changes to improve your overall sleep quality.",/r/AppleWatch/comments/11rk068/8_hours_in_bed_4_hours_apparently_awake_on_an/jca3auu/

Just throwing it out there that a) even if you don’t constantly snore like a stereotypical old man, sleep apnea may be a possibility; b) sleep apnea doesn’t necessarily have to be a huge, dangerous, scary thing; c) if you feel fine, then there is probably no reason to freak out.

Make it make sense","Not sure I can comment on why the change in your specific case, OP. However, I have had my VO2max tested in a lab before and then compared to my Apple Watch data and it was surprisingly close. I think from memory it was within 1 or 2mL/kg/min between the data sets of data, with apple watch overestimating. 

There are many factors that could influence it though. Walking vs running, terrain, heart rate, pace etc. Proper test have a specific protocol to followed. 

I’ve always found a standard 5km run (or anything 20-30min) on a relatively flat route to be a more effective at estimating VO2. It has to be more than just a leisurely stroll or slow jog though. Not a max effort necessarily but it needs to be up there. My guess it requires more of a sustained higher intensity reading to ensure they can capture relatively steady state workloads. It will estimate the data regardless but doing this has meant mine has been fairly accurate.",/r/AppleWatch/comments/11s7qvf/my_vo2_max_has_dropped_five_points_in_the_last/jccojvx/

To your original problem: nobody can help you here if the watch is activation locked. The one who sold you the watch may not even be the original owner. I only hope you can envoke Ebay’s buyer protection for this purchase because what you bought is unusable in its current form. Be more attentive in the future, too cheap listings are always suspicious, it would be best to make the sale in person if you can, because you can’t guarantee a watch is activation locked until you try to pair it yourself.

Also, the difference may be even bigger because braided loops naturally stretch out over time, even if you soak them regularly in hot water, so the band you are about to get may be half a size up anyway by the end of the year.

Also, if you keep using your 41mm bands with a 45mm watch, they should lock into place and the magnet will hold them securely but you’ll have a noticable gap on both ends at the connector, dirt can and will get in, the sharper edges of the gap left behind can get caught in stuff, so I don’t recommend it long term.",/r/AppleWatch/comments/11s5zea/migrating_from_41mm_to_45mm_also_changes_de_loop/jccg69d/

Pasted from above:

* ~~better battery~~ (at least for Ultra, already here. Time for the regular watch to get a bigger battery and/or more efficient SoC)
* ~~an option to get rid of the countdown in workouts~~ (already here, at least for the Ultra)
* messages in iCloud, so sync of message deletions, etc.
* better watch faces, if not a FaceKit to allow third parties to make watch faces
* an option to allow notification sounds/vibrations/alerts to go to the watch, the phone, or both, on an app-by-app basis
* the ability to sync with an iPad or iPod touch in addition to a phone
* the ability to see Health aggregated data on the watch
* ~~Support for intervals (time and/or distance based) in the running, biking, swimming workouts~~ (Done, though I would like to be able to edit in the Watch app rater than have to use the watch)
* Custom ringtones and notification tones
* Small heart complication that shows the last recorded heart rate instead of just a heart with no data
* Seconds display in more of the digital watch faces
* Customizable activity rings (e.g., turn off stand, move, or exercise if you don't care about one of them; add the ability to track total standing minutes rather than hours in which you stood and moved 1 minute; step count ring for people who want that; mindfulness ring for people who want that; etc.)

What? Bit if a non sequitur there. I actually have no idea what the “it” and “that” are that you’re referring to. 

However, it’s not recommended that people turn on afib history when they actually have none. Doing so a) turns off the irregular rhythm notifications, putting the user at higher actual risk; and b) considers regular transient episodes that may look like afib but are normal as actual afib, increasing the inaccuracy of the output.

Turning it on has the presumed benefit of additional HRV readings, which is not really beneficial since it fluctuates wildly throughout the day.",/r/AppleWatch/comments/11smprn/afib_not_working/jcfk3lz/

All of my regular watches are SS cases (many with full SS bands) so I naturally leaned into SS as I like the look.  Went with 45mm even though some may consider it too big for my wrist (165-170mm range) as I wanted to easiest to read option for when I'm not wearing my glasses.

Decided to try out an AW watch for better tracking on the fitness side of things, never really had any interested in one prior.  Been wearing this one 24x7 for past 8 days but I started switching the watch to my right wrist at night for give the left wrist a rest.

Having some minor wrist pain that I noticed within the first day.  I wear all my watches just above wrist bone and same with the AW.  I'm trying now to wear it about 1/2"" higher to see if there is any change.  The pain can come and go and I think it's due to the more centralized pressure from the dome on the back of the AW, something none of my other watches have.  Hoping my wrist just gets used to it with another week or so of wearing.  Been thinking about maybe getting cheap used 45mm Alu to see if ~10g lighter weight would be noticeable.  Would really like to stick with SS but if lighter option makes a difference, I could switch to Alu, or go 41mm SS which is just a few grams more than 45mm Alu, but am concerned about smaller screen size.",/r/AppleWatch/comments/11s1qk1/seeing_how_i_feel_about_an_aw_series_8_45mm_ss/jcba9ly/
